Saturday night

And the tap drips

Under the strip light

And I'm sitting

In the kitchen sink

And the tap drips

Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip



Waiting

For the telephone to ring

And I'm wondering

Where she's been

And I'm crying

For yesterday

And the tap drips

Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip



It's always the same


We sit in the same room

Side by side

I give you the wrong lines 

Feed you

Accuracy

Accuracy



Look into my eyes

We both smile

I could kill you

Without trying 

That's accuracy

Accuracy

Accuracy

...

Accuracy

Accuracy

Practice all day for accuracy

Mirror mirror on the wall


The sun rises slowly

On another day

The eastern sky grows 

Cold

Winter in water colours

Shades of grey



Something

Something holds me

Holds me hypnotized



I stare at the window

Stare at the window

Waiting for the day 

To go

Winter in water colours

Shades of grey


Slowly fading blue

The eastern hollows catch

The dying sun

Night-time follows 

Silence and black

Mirror pool mirrors

The lonely place

Where I meet you



See your head

In the fading light

And through the dark

Your eyes shine bright



And burn

Like fire

Burn like fire in Cairo

Burn like fire

Burn like fire in Cairo



Shifting crimson veil

Silken hips slide

Under my hand

Swollen lips whisper

My name

And I yearn

You take me in your arms

And start to burn

FIREINCAIRO

FIREINCAIRO

Then the heat disappears

And the mirage

Fades away

Burn like a fire in Cairo

Burn like a

Fire

Blaze like a fire in Cairo

Blaze like a

Fire

Flare

Burn like fire

Burn like

Fire in Cairo


No light

No speak

Stopped

Short

Grinding halt

Everything's coming to a griding halt



No sound

No people

Everything's coming to a griding halt

You wear your smile

Like it was going out of fashion

Dress to inflame

But douse any ideas of passion

You carry your love in a trinket

Hanging round your throat

Always inviting

Always exciting

But I must not take off my coat



Well I'm tired of hanging around

I want somebody new

I'm not sure who I've got in mind

But I know

That it's not you

That it's not you



You ask me questions

That I never wanted to hear

I am the only one

Just until you finish this year

I would murder you

If I had the alibi

Here in my hand

And you just laugh

'cause you don't understand



That I'm tired of hanging around

I want somebody new

I'm not sure

Who I've got in mind

But I know that it's not you

It's not you

It's not you

It's not you

It's not you

It's not you

No it's not you

That it's not you

It's not you

It's not you


I went into the butchers

I said wanted wanted wanted some

Meat

Pass

Me some of that steak over there

It looks so

Sweet



I lost my heart to a meathook



That butcher man was some 

Lady

He really stole my heart

He hung me up on his meathook

A real piece of

Slaughterhouse art



I lost my heart to a meathook



There's a meathook in my heart

Tearing me all apart

Ripping out my insides

But I just can't get away

I can't leave my

Meathook

Lost my heart to a meathook

Lost my heart to a meathook

Meathook


You know you turn me on

Eyes so white and legs so long

But don't try to talk to me

I won't listen to your lies

You're just an object in my eyes

You're just an object in my eyes



Sophisticated smile

You seduce in such fine style

But don't try to fool me

'cause I can see through your disguise

You're just an object in my eyes

You're just an object in my eyes



But I don't mind

I just don't care

I've got no objection

To you touching me there



Object object

Object object

Object object

Object object



You know just what to do

Lick your lips

And I want you

But don't try to hold me

'cause I don't want any ties

You're just an object in my eyes

You're just an object in my eyes



But I don't mind

I just don't care

I've got no objections

To you touching me there

You're just an object object

Object object

You're just an object

Midnight in the subway

She's on her way home

She tries hard not to run

But she feels she's not alone

Echoes of footsteps

Follow close behind

But she dare not turn around



Turn around

In the grace of your love I writhe in pain

In 666 ways I love you and I hope you feel the same



I'm for you

I'm for you



I'm killing myself for your love and again all is lost

I'm waiting for your call and I'm ready to take your

Six six six in my heart

And I'm longing for your touch and I welcome your sweet

Six six six in my heart (oh, my heart)

World was on fire, no one could save me but you

It's strange what desire will make foolish people do

I'd never dreamed that I'd need somebody like you

And I'd never dreamed that I'd need somebody like you



No, I wanna fall in love

(this world is only gonna break your heart)

No, I wanna fall in love

What a wicked game to play

To make me feel this way

What a wicked thing to do

To let me dream of you

What a wicked thing to say

You never felt this way

What a wicked thing you do

To make me dream of you



No, I wanna fall in love

(this world is only gonna break your heart)

No, I wanna fall in love

Nobody loves no one


Your pain ain't love



Can't you see he's the heartless

Your pain is not love

He's taking it too far

Don't you know it is wrong

You're the one for me lady

You are the one

If you'd only see in my heart

You'd know know all is not lost



Your time is running out

And you still haven't made up your mind

Can't you see he's the heartless

And you're one of a kind



He's the heartless



You can't you see he's the heartless

Your pain won't ever be love

It doesn't matter how hard you try

To you all is lost



He's the heartless

Will you let it rain

Let it rain

So won't you let it rain

Oh, let it rain

Won't you let it rain




All our times have come
Here but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain
We can be like they are

Come on baby... Don't fear the Reaper
Baby take my hand... Don't fear the Reaper
We'll be able to fly... Don't fear the Reaper
Baby I'm your man...

Valentine is done
Here but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity...
Romeo and Juliet

40,000 men and women everyday... Like Romeo and Juliet
40,000 men and women everyday... Redefine happiness
Another 40,000 coming everyday...We can be like they are

Come on baby... Don't fear the Reaper
Baby take my hand... Don't fear the Reaper
We'll be able to fly... Don't fear the Reaper
Baby I'm your man...

Love of two is one
Here but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear we couldn't go on
The door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew and then disappeared
The curtains flew and then he appeared
Saying don't be afraid

Come on baby... And we had no fear
And she ran to him... Then they started to fly
We looked backward and said goodbye
We had become like they are
She had taken his hand
We had become like they are

Come on baby...don't fear the reaper


I see it in your eyes

I feel it in your touch

I taste it from your lips

And baby more i love you



Can't you see my darling

That the harder i try

The more we grow apart

Please believe me

The sweeter the kiss

The colder turn your arms

And the colder grows your heart

And baby more i love you



I see it in your eyes

I feel it in your touch

I taste it from your lips

And baby more i love you



I see it in your eyes

I feel it in your touch

I taste it from your lips

And baby more i love you



And you're in my heart my darling

The closer i get

The more you're out of love

Don't you feel it

The colder your touch

The more it turns me on

And the faster beats my heart

And baby more i love you



I see it in your eyes

I feel it in your touch

I taste it from your lips

And baby more i love you



I see it in your eyes

I feel it in your touch

I taste it from your lips

And baby more i love you



I see it in your eyes

I feel it in your touch

I taste it from your lips

And baby more i love you



I see it in your eyes

I feel it in your touch

I taste it from your lips

And baby more i love you


>> withintemptation

She embraced, with a smile

As she opened the door.

A cold wind blows, it puts a chill into her heart.



You have taken away the trust,

you're the ghost haunting through her heart.

Past and present are one in her head,

you're the ghost haunting through her heart.



Take my hand as I wonder through,

All my life I gave to you.

Take my hand as I wonder through,

All my love I gave to you.



You have taken away the trust,

you're the ghost haunting through her heart.



Take my hand as I wonder through,

All my life I gave to you.

Take my hand as I wonder through,

All my love I gave to you.


The gates of time have opened,

Now, it's chains are broken.

An ancient force unleashed again



As I enter the portal,

I feel the enchantment

It takes me away, away from here



Come near me,

enter my private chambers,

I want to feel the warmth on my face,

light-in darkness,

lift me up from here.

Give me you wings,

to flee from my ivory tower.



As I enter the portal,

I feel the enchantment

The stars above are lying at my feet.



Come near me,

enter my private chambers,

I want to feel the warmth on my face,

light-in darkness,

lift me up from here.

Give me you wings,

to flee from my ivory tower.


After,

the cold darkness,

in the heart of the forest.

Where birds are singing,

for the new born sun



In the womb of the leaves,

on the branches of the trees,

lies the treasure of the morning,

the pearls of light.



Carried away by thee truculence of my world,

I got lost in the search for enlightenment,

The blue rain covered my roots and I forgot where I came from.



Carried away by thee truculence of my world,

I got lost in the search for enlightenment,

The blue rain covered my roots and I forgot where I came from.


Is there a place deep within?
A place where you hide your darkest sins

There's a strange kind of ambiance,
it's surrounding you
as a songstress you lure me,
towards the truth

Candles die down ass you leave the room
In my heart you leave no gloom
As you lure me I know the truth
You're a leprechaun, I see you through.

Is there a place deep within?
A place where you hide your darkest sins

There's a strange kind of ambiance,
it's surrounding you
as a songstress you lure me,
towards the truth


The shadows of the night,

are unleashed again.

Where their greed begins

the end is near.

A morbid hunger for blood,

lies in their cold black eyes

They've come to take our lives away.



One by one they died.

A massacre that took all night

They had no chance, it was no fight

You can't kill what has been killed before,

They died...



With shadows on its tale.

He stepped Through the portal,

locked the door and ate the key.

With his life they took their way to freedom,

and be became the final keeper of the key.


Cold are the bones of thy soldiers.

Longing for home, their little paradise.

I don't feel redemption on their side



Fallen from grace, help me rise again.

Fallen from grace, help me through.



Fallen from grace, help me through.

Fallen from grace.



Feel these hands, the pressure, the cold, tremble.



Do you hear these words.

Do you feel the wounds.

I'll never help you through.



Cold are thy souls,

I feel the resentment,

they feel betrayed,

They hate the cold

I don't feel redemption on their side.



Fallen from grace, help me rise again.

Fallen from grace, help me through.


Take away,

These hands of darkness.

Reaching for my soul.

Now, the cold wind,

blows out my candles.

Feeling,

only fear,

without any hope.



A thousand dark moons.

A thousand winters long.

A million fallen stars,

the candle burns in the womb.



We tried not to forget,

they live through us.

Slowly they die away at every candle's end



A thousand dark moons.

A thousand winters long.

A million fallen stars,

the candle burns in the womb.



We tried not to forget,

they live through us.

Slowly they die away at every candle's end


Birds and butterflies

Rivers and mountains she creates

But you'll never know

The next move she'll make

You can try

But it is useless to ask why

Cannot control her

She goes her own way



She rules until the end of time

She gives and she takes

She rules until the end of time

She goes her own way



With every breath

And all the choices that we make

We are only passing through on her way

I find my strength

Believing that your soul lives on

Until the end of time

I'll carry it with me



Once you will know my dear

You don't have to fear

A new beginning always starts at the end

Until the end of time

She goes her own way


When leaves have fallen

And skies turned into grey.

The night keeps on closing in on the day

A nightingale sings his song of farewell

You better hide for her freezing hell



On cold wings she's coming

You better keep moving

For warmth, you'll be longing

Come on just feel it

Don't you see it?

You better believe it.



When she embraces

Your heart turns to stone

She comes at night when you are all alone

And when she whispers

Your blood shall run cold

You better hide before she finds you



Whenever she is raging

She takes all life away

Haven't you seen?

Haven't you seen?

The ruins of our world



She covers the earth with a breathtaking cloak

The sun awakes and melts it away

The world now opens its eyes and sees

The dawning of a new day



Whenever she is raging

She takes all life away

Haven't you seen?

Haven't you seen?

The ruins of our world


In my hands

A legacy of memories

I can hear you say my name

I can almost see your smile

Feel the warmth of your embrace

But there is nothing but silence now

Around the one I loved

Is this our farewell?



Sweet darling you worry too much, my child

See the sadness in your eyes

You are not alone in life

Although you might think that you are



Never thought

This day would come so soon

We had no time to say goodbye

How can the world just carry on?

I feel so lost when you are not at my side

But there's nothing but silence now

Around the one I loved

Is this our farewell?



So sorry your world is tumbling down

I will watch you through these nights

Rest your head and go to sleep

Because my child, this not our farewell.

This is not our farewell.

I got the key, key to Gramercy Park 



Every night 

Looking for the fight 

Thoughts on the left 

The action's on the right 

As you know, the id wasn't meant to be starved 



Face white 

Revenge of the Hittites 

When you're inside 

And you thought to take a walk in the park 

Think someone is about to be carved 



From the other side of the Underscene 

To the boulevard of broken dreams 

To find the key to Gramercy Park 



I got the key, key to Gramercy Park 

Where it's safe to be afraid of the dark 

Maybe there we'll fuck by the heavenly stars 

But I might, might miss breaking in through the bars 



From the other side of the Underscene 

To the boulevard of broken dreams 

To find the key to Gramercy Park 

In the other time of mother speed 

Through evil eyes and make believe 

To where we bare the supremacy mark



And never look at the other place 

Stay with what's pristine that touches you 

Where the peril accentuates 

Something that could mean so much to you 

Try save a seat in the golden cage 

The media mass has still yet to say 

To simply pass or rise from the grave 



Now I've got the key to Gramercy Park 

Out of my way and I'm safe, not afraid of the dark 

Now I've got the key to Gramercy Park 

But I might, might miss breaking in through the bars


Let's take the longest way through the hallways of your mind.

Upon your knees, the phantom breeze of a shipwreck lost in time.

Your envy mirror, the kelly fear adorns the walls in slime.

Figure it out,just like you used to.

In the absense of proud, that's whne you're cursed to prove.

And as the perfect wings'll glide, cleansed are men of all the mice.

Past the pain,we tend to strive, or that's how it seems to beginners.

Accept awards throughout our lives, to make young lovers intertwine.

Perhaps the end'll come tonight, so hooray for the Winners.

A vast abyss, where lie dismissed ideas of yours and mine.

But brought to kneel by the Grecian Seal, we join the family line.

You'll never thrill the bold divisions in the sky,

of whom predestined you to always be the last in line.

Because the Winner's young and bright.

Let the heavens make it right.

A warm and gentle breeze at night.

Bereft,you are of plans to gain no misery, you're no surprise we're born to fight,

suck the marrow of life the Winners forever preside.


The desperate eyes that close, maybe it goes away.

Please rest tomorrow,and bring a satisfied day.

The restless urge of love that's worth, the burning for.

Surely it's that one comforting, love to give you more.

And this thought can be that begins, the brand new tangled web you're spinning.

Anyone can be your brand new love.

Any time the force can be broken, to tear your bitter world to be open.

Anyone can be your brand new love.

You won't be the first.

Your twisted change is normal...gossip, dirt.

Whisper to the nodding head, thrilled you fell apart instead of them.

But they will,'cause any hope for love can be killed.

If you need a different face, it's definite time to destroy this place.

Follow what you feel, you alone will decide what's real.

Anyone can be your brand new love.


Once upon, and once up high

A dandy dream, what means to die?

Things to come, as life goes by

The core of human equation

Tentragram present the sign

A sign to saviourize

Turn around, I'd like to know you

Everywhere and every why

The answer lay beyond the sky

Pass through the seven satellites pass on to the place we go to

(Learn to read!)

To rhyme, to count your primes

An earthly education

(Climb A Tree!)

In life in hopes to find

(The mid-space time - dilation)

On a Mansion World, the role's reversed

A slave becomes a master

On a Mansion World, the soul's converse

And life moves a little faster

We unify the universe

And arrive in the ever after

In the Mansion World, I might like to know you

Now and then it comes to mind 

I draw upon a long lost time 

So don't ask me why the angels won't cry 'cause you know what I've already told you 

Memories of Urantia girls they race around my brain in swirls 

You never ask me why the change is in the sky bring you up which to the hole 

that you go through

And now you're off you've done the time 

Prepare for divine invasion 

As the spirit climbs Morontia minds 

Ascend to the cosmic nation

On a Mansion World, the role's reversed

A slave becomes a master

On a Mansion World, the soul's converse

And life moves a little faster

We unify the universe

And arrive in the ever after

In the Mansion World, I might like to know you

New Urantia girl, everything's below you

On a Mansion World, the role's reversed

A slave becomes a master

On a Mansion World, the soul's converse

And life moves a little faster

We unify the universe

And arrive in the ever after

In the Mansion World, I might like to know you

Once upon, and once up high

A dandy dream, what means to die?


Laid awake throughout the night

Today the school's so loud

And now it's all so quiet

I plan to pack light

Cause tomorrow we'll fly

Taking off to a place

A land that's not so far away 



The boat above our heads for the walk to the shore

As feelings of dread soak the length of the oar

Connecticut hillsides surround the clouds soar

Dazed to the signs

I think back to times when gender crossed me 



Miss all those Christmasses

And the once careless Autumns 



Though there's space betwixt us which

Dissolves here round when the fog clears 



As we crept through the race

Old friends would line the banks

Cheering on as they played

Screaming all the lovely names

Then they'd start to file away

Come dust the time to rage 



The boat above our heads for the walk to the van

As luncheon awaits us while all the girls tan

And social engagements commence by the sand

Now our day is complete

We faced defeat, but felt the cool breeze 



Follow our dreams

And hold the lake in such dear regards

Against the best we thrusted

But the justice came when the bow touched


Through the mind we flee to space

As the shadows choose the place

Though afraid, my sleeper must awake

So I've used up all and left this time



Station

Towards where we're falling

Faces

Glowing blue eyes upon me

Waste us

Or make us slaves till death like upon me

Or turn around and fake they're proud

I've found my true calling



Well beyond the mortal plane

Lies the place where one's life can be exchanged

No more conscience, no more pain

The now, the past, the future stay the same



At the station

Towards where we're falling

Faces

Glowing blue eyes upon me

Taste us

Or make us slaves till death like upon me

Or show the world exist without the day

While the tall one tries convincing us to stay


Now you know

Places where I live

When I couldn't grow

Downward you'll soon drift

On the sailless boat

Nothing left to give

All I see is throat 



Flowing glower 

Witless knower

Seedless sower 



If it's all a lie

Will you realise?



Right before we die

My soul leads to the wrong

Changeling of the night

Now that I bleed a song

Purely based on fright

Sad with my face so long

I have this new sight 



Flowing glower

Witless knower

Five steps lower 



If I tell a lie

Will you realise? 



Numb the pain

Way high and real low

Now it feels the same

Have love or feel so

Hollowed out with shame

Hoping to see the day

With my brand new name 



Flowing glower

Seedless sower

I'm bipolar 



If I die tonight

Will you be alright? 



Then in time you'll find

Thirst becomes boring

Quest your heart and mind

Now that we're soaring

Over space and time

Done with exploring

All you are is mine 



Flowing glower

Ruthless flower

Breathless blower 



If it's all a lie

Will you realise?



Seek and you shall find

Everything inside

Read between the lines

I'll show you the light

Here in the afterlife


A morbid beauty

Glows in resonation

Mercurial signs they read

Make real our minds

True fascinations

For now we're rolling

And kinda golden

As time keeps folding

We're old when our poor souls depart

Whereas cold cruel jokes now make you cry

One day you'll take them in your stride 



All of the time we've resided here

You'll see our chalices rise

With ever endless tears

And illusions they fly

But someday soon will clear

Just sit back and recline

I'll guide you through the years 



Through the future years

As they'll soon appear

Someday all too near

Now the distance clears 



Bad ways which rule all the ways we go

Through black and the gloom

Consecutive days and plain afternoons

The things in life

They pass the time

While those all around are bored 



Though we come down in real demise

Trek through all of the feelings with no tears in eyes

Kept fear veiled so it hides

Life's never forced or dry

So theres nothing inside me

I just seem alive 



To the future years

As they'll soon appear

Dressed in slacks as we will

So its stars they steer 



Just tie a silk sheet round your neck

And twist it till your face turns cherry red 



All of the time we've resided here

You'll see our chalices rise

With ever endless tears

And illusions they fly

But someday soon will clear

Just sit back and recline

I'll guide you through the years


Well she comes from the land

Of Valencian winds

Deciduous daydream

Dressage round the bend

See sometimes Miss Maybe

The mistress of when

A triptych of new touch

From heaven to men



She likes nice cars

Invisible trends

She bites the heads off

Her mutual friends

We dine at the table

She sits at the end

She likes big words

And playing pretend



Come now dear boys

How, where to begin?

She's Ursula, major

Of the prison within

She's always in parties

She's struggling to win

Your sashes of New-Ro

From psychic to sin



Let down your void

Your need to defend

So pseudo-mindacious

She's cruel in bed

You'd think she was precious

Something like you said

Cause she's got the secret

In which fate depends



She likes nice cars

Impossible trends

She bites the heads off

Her beautiful friends

We dine at the table

She sits at the end

She likes big words

Although we'll never comprehend



She likes nice cars

Invisible trends

She bites the heads off

Her musical friends

We dine at the table

She sits at the end

She likes big words



She likes nice cars

Impossible trends

She bites the heads off

Her beautiful friends

She lights all the candles

They burn at both ends

She likes the ones

That you'll never understand



She likes big words


How the story rolls

Magic's taught and history's told

A glory hole

Which through gazed her eyes of gold

Those veins run cold

Mystery's wife evades her soul

Scaring to and fro 



Tearing through the snow

As she makes her darling coat

Hoarding all the shawls

Now her evil highness rose 



Kind of like Shakespearean prose

Without the rose

Avid as she sows

Cruella grows

Horace and Jasper stole

So let the horror flow 



Black and white in hair

Elegantly gaunt in frame

A boney flare

Which christened Cruel with creepy grace

Always smokey air

Circling one lurch, Hepburn face

In her head which filled the space

Was the one hellacious taste

As she aims her fate

Nothing flees her sore embrace 



As the biggest mistake that Cruel ever made

Was when she left her cave and started to reign

As the love for her fades

Our feelings won't change

So my darling Cruella

We see through the grey 



In her cold glare

Loveliest and rare

Frightened you'll soon wear

And this elegantly haunting is so fair

Theres no reason to part from her cold lair

She has all of the loveliest and rare 

Things which frighten at first

But she'll soon wear 



She's a regional spark from this nowhere

And this elegant loveliness so fair

Taking strolls through the dark by the moon's glare

As she listens for barks in the night air

Always searching for marks on the white hair 



Cruel, you're so fair

Three heavy stones will keep it from floating,
Weigh it down to the bottom, food for the fishes.
And I know that it won't be discovered,
'cause I will be careful, so very careful.
What if it doesn't rain for days and the river is,
Reduced to its muddy bed?
With the corpse exposed, I would work in haste,
And I might bury the bones in a shallow grave.
And the rain comes and moves rocks and the stones,
Washes away all the dirt and the mud flows,
Bones are exposed and well,
You know how that goes!

I wait for the day when I finally defile,
The bodies of my ex-lover's lovers.
I'll pile high to the sky,
The bodies of my ex-lover's lovers.

Die die die die die die,
Die die die die die die die,
Watch them die. 

I saw you with him. You looked so happy.
All of that can change, cause I am so lonely.
And I have lots of time to send you straight to the Devil. 
I'm taking my time,
To plan your demise.
What if I were to cut you up and mail each part
To a different town? 
It would take the most,
Brilliant private eye,
The rest of his life,
Just to put you together.
A piece in each mailbox all over the planet,
From Moscow to Tokyo to Guadalajara.

I wait for the day when I finally defile,
The bodies of my ex-lover's lovers.
I'll pile high to the sky,
The bodies of my  ex-lover's lovers.

I wait for the day when I finally destroy,
The bodies of my ex-lover's lovers.
I'll pile high to the sky,
The bodies of my ex-lover's lovers.

Die die die die die die,
Die die die die die die die,
Watch them die. 

I saw you with him, you looked so happy.
That will never change because I know myself too well. 
I don't have the courage,
To carry out my dreams,
And only there will I see them,

Die die die die die die,
Die die die die die die die,
Watch them die. 


Do I look the same to you? 
Cause I don't feel so
You know everything must change 
As time goes by
Though it feels like yesterday 
When we first met
I feel I'm sinking deeper

Do you look the same to me? 
Well I don't think so
Cause you know everything must change 
As time goes by
Like the flowers that dry
Locking inside
Forever their beauty
Beauty

And they said this feeling fades
It gets stronger everyday
And they say that beauty fades
You're more beautiful than ever
They said we'd drift away
We're still standing here
And it feels like every day's 
Our Anniversary

Well I stumble through the dark 
And light a candle
And the path the wax will take
No one can know
And you said it looked like snow
Or maybe clouds,
and I think it looks like Heaven

So we make it into a ring 
And make a mold
And we melt above the flames 
The whitest gold
When hot and cold collide 
What's left in place
Is forever and ever

And they said our love would fade
it gets stronger everyday
And they say that beauty fades
You're more beautiful than ever
They said we'd drift away
We're still standing here
And it feels like every day's 
Our Anniversary

Some say things worth having 
Take some time
As they get older 
They get better

La lalala lalalala...

And they said our love would fade
it gets stronger everyday
And they say that beauty fades
You're more beautiful than ever
They said we'd drift away
We're still standing here
And it feels like every day's 
Our Anniversary

And they said our love would fade
it gets stronger everyday
And they say that beauty fades—
You're more beautiful than ever

They said we'd drift away
Well as long as we're together
It feels like every day's
Our Anniversary


You know it's true we're both the same.
In a storm of words we get lost in what is said.
You know me and you see through me.
So why are you confused by the things I say and do?
Do you know me?

You see the strain upon my face.
Please, don't rain on my parade.
It comes too light, it comes in waves,
It's gone too late.

It goes astray, it goes too far and you say
It's clear I know where all your buttons are.
It's not so strange, you know, it's not so queer
That I know they're there 'cause I'm the one
Who put them there, exactly as you feared.

I know you and I see though you
So why am I surprised by the things you say and do?
I don't know why.

I see the strain upon your face.
I won't rain on your parade.
It comes too light it comes in waves.
It's gone too late.

Don't steal the smile from off my face.
Please, don't rain on my parade.
It comes too light, it comes in waves,
It's gone too late.

I know that I can't replace you
And it would be a lie to say that I could ever try.

Don't steal the smile from off my face.
Please, don't rain on my parade.
It comes too light, it comes in waves,
It's gone too late.

You see the strain upon my face
Please, don't rain on my parade.
It comes too light, it comes in waves,
It's gone too late.

It's gone too late
It cuts two ways
It cuts two ways
It's gone too late


The guy upstairs is such a freak.
For five years now I've had a leak.
What does he do up there?
All day long he "sleeps all day,"
Then he goes out and comes home
In the most intoxicated way.
As far as I can tell, he juggles bowling balls
But he's not good at it.
He moves his furniture then at six am
He pulls out the vacuum cleaner
To suck his room.
The guy downstairs is also crazy.
He spent some time in an institute.
It did him not much good
He's off his medication,
And he starts screaming,
"Virgin Mary, you fucking alien!"
According to him Jesus Christ smokes crack,
And other sundry things.
But it's the man upstairs who pulls the strings,
Won't let me sleep.

Please, kill that man upstairs.
If you ever loved me, you'll do this one thing,
Won't you sweetheart?
Please murder that man upstairs.
If you want to be my friend,
You'll have to prove you mean it.

I used to think that rent control was a good idea,
Until I moved here. 
Now I'm the only sucker,
Paying more than a hundred bucks a room.
And I'm surrounded by lunatics who don't,
Even need a moon.
But it's the man upstairs who pulls the strings,
Won't let me sleep.

Please, kill that man upstairs.
If you ever loved me, you'll do this one thing,
Won't you sweetheart?
Please murder that fuck upstairs.
If you want to be my friend
You'll have to prove you mean it.

Then there's the lady across the hall,
Who always knows what's going on.
And Machu Pichu down the stairs,
Who is selling crack from door to door.
14B are refugees and 14A transvestite whores.
But you know who is coming home,
He's falling up his drunken stairs.

Please, kill that man upstairs.
If you ever loved me, you'll do this one thing,
Won't you sweetheart?
Please murder that fuck upstairs.
If you want to be my friend,
You'll help me get a good night sleep.


He slips in through the back door,
And he helps himself to the patients' medicine.
And he likes to look important.
And he always looks like he's impotent.
And each tale that he tells of the lives that he's saved,
Is a spade full of dirt as he's digging his grave.
And the deep blackened hallow he's patched with a badge,
Is the happiness he's never had.
And he says,

"It's all right, they know me here.
It's all right, they know me, they know me."

His flames are yesterday's tinsel,
And his belly's the sail that propels him,
Onto the rocks.
And you know that even the noble Don Quixote would,
Call him a mile away for a windmill.
And each Sunday that passes he's rid of his sins,
And he's ready to do them all over again.
And God won't be mad for the money he stole,
he put some in the offering bowl.
And he says,

"It's all right, they know me here.
It's all right, they know me, they know me."

Soon comes the moment that all souls await,
Just as sure as St. Peter will padlock the gate.
But deep in his wallet's a shiny new coin,
So, he turns and he winks and says,

"It's all right, they know me here.
It's all right, they know me, they know me.

It's all right, they know me here.
It's all right, they know me, they know me."

Devils, for liars, put brands on the fires
And everyone burns, with your glowing, red name on it.
Finally, you've come to a place where they,
Know you well


You bitch you hurt me,
And now I can never forgive you.
You bitch, you bitch,
You hurt me.


You set the snakes loose inside my belly
They're done with my supper
they start on my endocrine lining
You said, "Please, stop your whining!"

This isn't a love song
I'm through writing those for you
All the while you claimed
the ghost in you lives, but it's dead
It's inside my head
And all that I know is that it's midnight
and you haven't called

Oh when you sigh, and you cry
I figure you probably lie and I'm here waiting
And all I can see, if there's anyone fooled
then it's probably me
And I'm here waiting

And all that I know is that it's midnight
and you haven't called
All that I see is that it's midnight
and you haven't called.
All that I know is I'm left with frustration
and this hyperactive imagination of mine

I would love to lay all my faith in you
Why can't I let fate have it's way with me?
I would love to but...

It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over!

You say you're at mother's but do you mean LOVERS?
Are you in the amorous arms of another?
It chills every bone in me, straight to the core of me
Your girlfriend concurs with you, is she your alibi?
How did you get that sweet little girl to lie?
Meanwhile I'm here waiting

And all that I know is that it's midnight
and you haven't called
All that I see is that it's midnight
and you haven't called.
All that I know is I'm left with frustration
and this hyperactive imagination of mine

I would love to place all my faith in you
Why can't I let fate have it's way with me?
I would love to place all my trust in you
Why can't I? 'cause..

It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over again!

This isn't a love song
I'm through writing those for you
All the while you claimed
that the ghost in you lives, but it's dead
and it's inside my head
And all that I know is it's midnight
and you haven't called


Ravens land upon her hair,
Clouds adrift on her skin,
A smile that tugs upon my soul,
And whispers gently in my ear.

Eyes of honey look me down,
Lips like roses line her mouth,
Steely arrows in the air,
Are wilted flowers at her toes.

And if you ask me how I know,
What she looks like I will tell you,
She left yesterday.

Eyes are east and lips are west,
Pulls my head against her breast.
Logic, north and Lust is south,
Pulls my fingers to her mouth.
Legs as firm as canyon walls,
From leaping high above the moon.
When she drifts down on the air,
The ground can't wait to kiss her toes.

And if you ask me how I know,
What she looks like I will tell you,
She left yesterday.

Ravens land upon her hair,
Clouds adrift on her skin,
A smile that tugs upon my soul,
And whispers gently in my ear.

And if you ask me how I know,
What she looks like I will tell you,
She left yesterday,
She left yesterday,
She left yesterday,
She left yesterday.


Last night a moth came to my bed,
And filled my tired weary head,
With horrid tales of you,
I can't believe it's true.
But then the lamp shade smiled at me,
And it said, "Believe," it said, "believe."
I want you to know it's nothing personal

First time I had sex I was three.
First time consenting was thirteen.
Though you weren't there you remind,
Me of those hands.
Roses are red, violets are blue,
If I'm schizophrenic, then I am too!
Whatever it takes to escape.

I hope you understand,
Why I'm forced to take your life in my hands.
I want you to know it's nothing personal.
And though we've never met,
I've seen your image in a million waking dreams.
Your eyes they call to me, "Set me free."

Did I ever tell you? You look like my mother.
She once left me in a supermarket.
I promised myself that I'd never feel that way again.
Did I ever tell you? You look like my dear old mother.

I hope you understand,
Why I'm forced to take my life in your name.
I want you to know it's nothing all the same.
And though we've never met,
I've seen your image in a million waking dreams.
Your eyes they call to me, "Set me free."

It's not easy being the chosen.
It's not easy being the chosen.
It's not easy being the chosen.
It's not easy being the chosen.


The sun goes down while children listen,
All the way down.
Black as a crow is the space in which you,
Leave me standing.
All the way down.
If you'd seen the light of day,
I'd hold you there tonight.
And if you'd seen the light we'd go,
All the way down.

Up there in space,
You're looking down on us,
Looking all the way down.
And if you fell to Earth, 
They have a name they call it, they say, 
"All the way down."
If you burned your wings and fell into my arms,
You know I wouldn't mind being,
All the way down.

I can't believe in Hell,
But I've got to believe in Heaven.
I wouldn't sleep at night not knowing,
That you were somewhere better.

If you burned your wings and fell into my arms,
You know I wouldn't mind being,
All the way down,
All the way down,
All the way down.

All your hidden faces
Your seven veils unfold
Give me forbidden places
All your tales untold
Give me ever and always
Ever and always
Body and soul

Heaven and hope eternal
Over your heart of gold
Sun and sunset
Burning in the flame you hold
Ever and always
Give me ever and always
Body and soul

Yesterday
Today
Tomorrow
Body and soul

Give me ever the years you wept inside when cold 
All the sins and secrets never cried
All the dreams you kept and the tears you sold
Give me
Give me ever and always
Ever and always
Body and soul

Your heart
Your mind
Your body and soul


Through the cables and the underground now
The faceless breathless calls
This is babel, sensurround now
This place is death with walls

Too much contact, no more feeling
The sound around them all
Acid on the floor so she walk on the ceiling
And the body electric flashes on the bathroom wall
And the body electric flashes on the bathroom wall
Crawling to the corners where the idiot children call
See the body flashing on the bathroom wall


Take a last decision and the cars to move it 
past information 
tunnel vision and the scars to prove it 
everybody got a reservation 

far beyond the black horizon 
beyond the things you know 
everybody got a destination 
everybody got a place to go 

take a walk downtown to where the victims go 
take your shadow to the end to the very last window 

everybody got friends got shot upside and over down the line 
everybody got assignations 
I got mine 

take a one way ticket to the main attraction 
cut a hole between the ground and sky 
take a railway track to a chain reaction 
cross my heart and take a ride 

far beyond the black horizon 
beyond the things you know 
everybody got a destination 
everybody got a place to go


One more night spent on your mirror 
Black maria, in your eyes 
This stuff so strange and lonely 
England fades away 
In your eyes 

Two o'clock in the morning 
Ninety-four degrees 

Through the stillness through the heat 
The cars go by on Fifth and 
Breathing slow 
Get up off the floor and angel 
Put your clothes on 
It's time for us to go 

Let's take a ride


In the western sky
My kingdom come

So still so dark all over Europe
And I ride down the highway 101
By the side of the ocean headed for sunset
For the kingdom come
For the


Black
Black planet
Black
Black world


Run around in the radiation
Run around in the acid rain
On a 
Black
Black planet
Black planet hanging over the highway
Out of my mind's eye
Out of the memory
Black world out of my mind

Still so dark all over Europe
And the rainbow rises here
In the western sky
The kill to show for
At the end of the great white pier 
I see a



Run around in the radiation
Tune in turn on burn out in the acid rain on a…




And in the summer when the clouds show through
I might go the same way too if
You and I could talk together
Well what am I supposed to do with
You and I would walk together
Then with always close around and
Now you gaze toward the doorway
When the weather comes falling down


And when the rain comes down
Would you choose to walk or stay
Would you choose to walk
Would you choose to stay
Would you
Walk walk walk walk walk away
(away) (away) away away (away) away 
away away walk away
Would you choose to walk away

And when the rain comes down
Would you choose to walk or stay
Would you choose to walk 
Would you choose to stay
Would you
Walk walk walk walk walk away 

Though when the day is nearly
Through I might see the same way too if
You would name the things 
That bring you down on me so I could say it's
Not quite true if you don't really
Know or understand the circumstance
Behind then I might clear your
Mind and you won't have to go so




It's just a feeling
I get sometimes
A feeling
Sometimes
And I get frightened
Just like you
I get frightened too
But it's...


(no no no) No time for heartache
(no no no) No time to run and hide
(no no no) No time for breaking down
(no no no) No time to cry

Sometimes in the world as is you've 
Got to shake the hand that feeds you
It's just like Adam says
It's not so hard to understand
It's just like always coming down on
Just like Jesus never came and
What did you expect to find 
It's just like always here again it's...



Everything will be alright
Everything will turn out fine
Some nights I still can't sleep
And the voices pass with time
And I keep 

No time for tears
No time to run and hide
No time to be afraid of fear
I keep no time to cry 




And she came to look for me
Sold me name and innocence
Took my key
And told me to follow her
Down from igor with her bangles and her reference
One from the church from the valley of the
Well she wanted a haven and a place to hide
So I gave her an alibi took her inside but 

A rock and a hard place await for for me
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
Everything I ever did right or wrong
Hid out of sight where I belong, belong

And I didn't have the heart to tell her 
Why
And there wasn't a part of me that
Didn't want to say goodbye but

Cause and effect go hand in hand with
The devil may care but I don't mind and I
Thought she'd never quite understand so I
Left her there that night but will she 
Find me? I don't think so, no
When you go, you go alone
And I'm gone....
far away 

And I didn't have the heart to tell 
Why
And there wasn't a part of me that 
Didn't want to say goodbye but...




In a sea of faces, in a sea of doubt
In this cruel place your voice above the maelstrom
In the wake of this ship of fools I'm falling further down
If you can see me, Marian, reach out and take me home.....


I hear you calling Marian
Across the water, across the wave
I hear you calling Marian
Can you hear me calling you to
Save me, save me, save me from the 
Grave...
Marian 

Marian, there's a weight above me
And the pressure is all too strong
To breathe deep
Breathe long and hard
To take the water down and go to sleep
To sink still further
Beneath the fatal wave
Marian I think I'm drowning
This sea is killing me



Was ich kann und was ich könnte
(What I can do and what I could do)
Weiß ich gar nicht mehr
(I just don't know anymore)
Gib mir wieder etwas Schönes
(Give me something beautiful again) 
Zieh mich aus dem Meer
(Drag me from the sea)
Ich höre dich rufen, Marian
(I hear you calling Marian)
Kannst du mich schreien hören
(Can you hear me calling?)
Ich bin hier allein
(I am here alone)
Ich höre dich rufen, Marian
(I hear you calling Marian)
Ohne deine Hilfe verliere ich mich in diesem Ort
(Without your help I am lost in this place)






See a body and the dream of the dead days
Following lost and blind
Living, far from here
Tomorrow is hard to find
And it seems like twenty-five years of
Promises and give me more
Scenes of a hand me down in
Dresses heard before

First and last and always: 'til the end of time
First and last and always: Mine

Maybe it's not so easy
Maybe it's a way too long
Say, say you'll be by me
When the evidence comes along

(My calling)
(My time)

See a body and the dream of the dead days
A following lost and blind
Cross my heart with silver
Here's the key behind
Seems like twenty-five years of
Ever after, ever more more more
Seems I wore this face for you
Far too long before

First and last and always: My calling, my time
First and last and always: Mine
First and last and always: 'til the end of the end of time
First and last and always: Mine
First and last and always: 'til the end of time
First and last and always: Mine

Here stands the canvas beauty at her door
Calling beneath the blockade floor
See him turn bedeviled and blacked 
For the canvas beauty had locked him back
Away from the king of hearts so pure
In with temptations alluring pour
Away from her his compass mass
The everglade the bonny lass

The actress love that he mistook
A siren for his aging look
The actress love that he mistook
A siren love for his aging look

Here stands Dorian at her need

In Hedonisms shaft like look
He wears the id the painter mistook
And with her flame he'll burn its flesh
Burn the freeze transcend the mesh

Riders wings you give me back
The siren for his aging look
The actress love that he mistook
The siren love for his aging look

Here stands Dorian at her need


Time flies
Time crawls
Like an insect
Up and down the walls

The light pours out of me
The light pours out of me

The conspiracy
Of silence ought
To revolutionize
My thought

The light pours out of me
The light pours out of me

The cold light of day
Pours out of me
Leaving me black
And so healthy

The light pours out of me
The light pours out of me

It jerks out of me
Like blood
In this still life
Heart beats up love

The light pours out of me
The light pours out of me


I could use your gullibility
Distort the painful truth
Present a fear and laugh at you
Leave you lost unsure removed
The must I feel to put it right
Put an end to naive faith
In slick successes avenue
The vacuum of save face

Direct words can turn lost minds
Towards some monster seed
Lyrics sung from pretty looks
Can on the reader feed
Be strong to check and recognise
The pretty face is all
But being used to sell you songs
That never say it all

The incident meets the senses
The illusions in a mask
The sun of a summer afternoon
Docility rocks the mask
Broken loose from moorings
In a flash the swell had passed
Towards the beach with unabated speed
Confessions of a mask


Should the world fail to fall apart
And lock off in a remote sky
Ideas can matter too much

Can't hear for lack of sleep
Breathing in the smoking ruins
The rockets in the shadows whispering
Singing in the underground
Love and the never men
Can't hear for lack of sleep

Looking for the past
Try to slip the script
Gun the lowest plane
Hidden all eyes know
Try to slip the script
Gun the lowest plane
Hidden all eyes know

There's some use in treating courage
As a remote friend
Learning what it is to lie
Stop crash fall
On a leper mass of swelling glass
Cleaning up the swamps
You are the heart of hearts
Wonder dig and try
Tear it up and learn to bless the readers eye


The love of the Never man
Jumps through the blackest heat
His imminent green innocent sweet
Is blocked and returns
The love of the Never man
Is blocked and returns
The love of the Never man

Contains a story he
Never being heard
Dreaming of a better time to come
When better days will mean
Being, hearing never sleep
The Never man will weep
-Never sleep at night
The Never man will weep
-Never sleep at night

Swimming in the idea moat
Dreams of better days will come
Those re-occurring maybes that -
-force the never haze will come
The love of the Never man jumps through the blackest heat
His eminent innocent sweet
His innocent sweet

The love of the Never man 
Can't breath for smoking ruins
Third eye glimpses a second thought
Is blocked and returns
Can't breath for smoking ruins
Contains a story he
Never being heard 
When better days will mean-
-can't breath for smoking ruins
Love of the Never man
Jumps through the blackest heat


Of course we can see
From the lipstick that's used
From even the wig that sits
That's all we see of you
I've done it among the many who

From paint to health
Bricka-brack fashion
Giving you the talk back
Giving you the buzz
It's called a feedback
It's fierce
It's not from above
It's fierce

Tell my friends they're all potential
They're all potential Godsends
I feel that this is me coming
You'll never meet me

Oh young and pure
An inward girl
A simple shape and mind
A no-mans land
A chosen ground
A sitting for the sign
Sashed and shorn
Hallowed be her name

Saying 'no I don't want to talk anymore'
Is the prerogative of the superstar
I say no all the time
I'm super 
So are you! say no

Tell my friends they're all potential
They're all potential Godsends
I feel that this is me coming
You'll never meet me

The message clear
For weak and strong
He takes no pleasure in your pain
The face is distant death

Saying 'no I don't want to talk anymore'
Is the prerogative of the superstar
Put yourself on the line
Stay super 
Say you! 
Say no!

Tell my friends they're all potential
They're all potential -
-Godsends

I feel that this is me coming
Tell them they'll never meet me


How rich is your surface
How much do you care
Does your blue heart turn away
How deep is that stare
Time hints that it's on your side
Don't think it's there
What's past could be a teaser line
Between mind and air

Was it a lie
Was it the truth
Does your blue heart turn away
As you hit the roof

I never seem to get the drift
When I hear some crowd talk
It isn't only their chat-chat-chatter
Or the one line track of thought
Isolation lies like dread
Outcast fears
In which they are so so locked
Reduced to tears

Reduced to

Was it a lie
Was it the truth
Does blue heart turn away
As you hit the roof

Interviewed your dreams 
Walked on thin air
No time to wonder now
As I break through their stare
Would they understand
If I were to show
That their answers burned to ground
So I turned to go

So I turned to

Was it a lie
Was it the truth
Does your blue heart turn away
As you hit the roof


Teach him to be happy
Teach him some control
Teach him what his friends are

With your sunken eyes
And your pretty looks
Underneath a see through disguise
You are desperate for a good hook
Desperate for a good hook
You try so hard
To see what you want
The answer is clear

Should you see your face
In the mirror dear
Is that the movement of fear?
You are kicking out at them
Judging all the time
As you criticise the bull
You do it just as fine
You are the source of what
You'd call weird pop
Well that's all you've seen
That's all you've got

Teach him to be happy
Teach him some control
Teach him what his friends are
This is the movement of fear ha


The girls won't touch me
'Cause I've got a misdirection
Living at night isn't helping my complexion
The signs all saying it's a social infection
A little bit of fun's never been an insurrection

Mama threw me out till I get some pants that fit
She just won't approve of my strange kind of wit
I get so excited, always gotta lose
Man that send me off
Let them take the cure

Don't need a cure
Need a final solution

Buy me a ticket to a sonic reduction
Guitars gonna sound like a nuclear destruction
Seems I'm a victim of natural selection
Meet me on the other side, another direction

Don't need a cure 
Need a final solution


Allah'im lütfet ki gittiğimiz her yere bariş götürelim
Bölücü degil bagdaştirici birleştirici olabilelim
Nefret olan yere sevgi, yaralanma olan yere affedicilik
Kuşku olan yere inanç, ümitsizlik olan yere ümit
Karanlik olan yere aydinlik ve üzüntü olan yere
Sevinç satici olmayi bize lütfet yarabbi
Kusurlari gören degil, kusuru örtenlerden
Teselli arayanlardan degil teselli edenlerden
Anlayis bekleyenlerden degil, anlayis gösterenlerden
Yalniz sevilmeyi isteyenlerden değil
Sevenlerden olmamiza yardim et
Yagmur gibi hiç bir sey ayirt etmeyip
Aktigi her yere canlilik bahsedenlerden
Günes gibi hiç bir sey ayirt etmeyip
Isigiyla tüm varliklari aydinlatanlardan;
Toprak gibi hersey üstüne bastigi halde
Hiç bir seyini esirgemeyip
Nimetlerini herkese verenlerden olmayi bize lutfet
Alan degil, veren ellerin
Affedici oldugu için affedilenlerin
Hak ile dogan hak ile yasayan
Hak ile ölenlerin ve sonsuz yasam da yeniden doganlarin
Safina katilmayi bize nasip eyle.

Amin

Our gang's dark oath

Well I have promised not to save you

From this hotel

Let you go 



Well it's drugs that is breaking us down now

It's mind numbing freight train hears the sound

Give reason to what ties us to our past

And fights for our lives



I can feel death combing through my hair

and breaking tide

I can feel death combing through my hair

and breaking tide



It's not time to give up 

It's not our time to give in 

It's not time to give up

It's our time to give all

(Our Lives)

Depends on the dawn breaking tide

(Our Lives)

Depends on what's wrong and what is right

(Our Lives)

Depends on the dawn breaking tide

(Our Lives)

Depends on what's wrong and what is right



(Our Lives)

Depends on the dawn breaking tide

(I set) I set (my friends) my friends on fire (fire) 

well I looked at your grave I do not feel alive

(I set) I set (my friends) my friends on fire (fire) 

well I looked at your eyes I do not feel alive. 

I set (I set) my friends (my friends) on fire,

now I will give up

now I will give my life.



If I tell you now I will not feel alive,

If I kill you now I will not feel pride,

If I kill you now I have set those fields on fire,

Yaaaaa, yaaaaaa, well I gave one more time,

Yaaaaa, yaaaaaa, well I gave one more time now,



"The sun came through the leaves and lit them 

up like it was on fire, right at sunset"

Let's look the world into the eyes (like it was on fire) 

and say just one more time (like it was on fire), much less.

Let's look the world into the eyes (like it was on fire) 

and say just one more time, one more time.

One more time!

Yeah, one more

Yeah, one more time

One more life when I pray it's time.

When I gave one more time, 

to lie into the after life, 

One more time. I praise one more lie.


Let's show this world we can be alright, 

without it's sponsors word 

I think my mind is almost washed, 

America might change it's time line if 

the media fucked off 

and quit filling kids with lies.

I just can't let this record play (playnowIcan'tfind)

cause I feel like the masses are quietly lied to, 

and they don't discuss the way (waynowIcan'tfind)

we treat foriegn country's who oppose our policy 

And I feel (andIfeel) 

so hollow 

like a trapped soul inside of a desperate heart, 

And I feel (andIfeel) 

so hollow 

this pledge of resistance is about to start now,

I just can't sing this song with out (withoutmyheartIfeelso) 

my heart cause I'm so alive ya I'm so alive

and I know this empire is run on (faithinanempirenow)

fear and this greed sets apart from innocence 

And I feel (andIfeel) 

so hollow 

like a trapped soul inside of a desperate heart, 

And I feel (andIfeel) 

so hollow 

this pledge of resistance is about to start NOW,

(Now)-This-(This)-Pledge-(Pledge) of resistance now wont you

This-(This)-Pledge-(Pledge) of resistance now wont you

"We have nailed our names in the pages of history enough for today"

Let's light this world on fire

and watch it burn

Let's light this world on fire


The second before you die 

must be filled with the fear of discontent now,

a flash of life and what 

was worth everything you meant.

We're all righteous, we've lost our faith, our faith

We're all righteous and afraid,

We're all righteous, we've lost our faith, our faith

We're all righteous and afraid

A fine way to die, a fine way to die, 

I have found the answers to my problems now

A fine way to die, a fine way to die, 

I have found the answers to my problems now

1 - Discover the feeling

2 - Nail it down

3 - Find out the future

4 - Just don't care anymore

Anymore

They will syphon us

will syphon out our lives again

They will syphon us 

will syphon out our lives again, they will find

They will syphon us 

will syphon out our lives again

We found the bridge of reason 

we found the shore of faith

we found it's just beneath our skin 

and but it's our own faith 

We found the bridge of reason 

we found the shore of faith

we found it's just beneath our skin 

and but it's our own faith

Faith here we go, here we go, well it's all washed

here we go, here we go, here we go, well it's all washed up turned grey


I remember when I used to wake up
I remember what I used to be
I remember how I used to wake up so wrong now
I remember this life I left behind
On empty shelves 
In empty rooms
In lifeless skies
In lifeless skies
In empty shells
I remember when I used to
Be my own self
I remember when
We were so young
I remember when I used to
Wake up so lost now
I remember when
we were so 
My friend
My own
My end

Break 
watch me break

She won't have to stand and walk alone now
to stand and walk alone
Don't have to stand and walk between us now 
forever wanting

This life has never made me question
is it wrong to think
how empty is the answers
This life has never made me question
is it wrong to think
how empty is the answers

This life I left behind
This life I left behind for you
Arrghhh!!!


Is seventeen so far away from here?

At twenty-one I live a different life

I never dreamed I could

And as I pick up pieces I can't let go

of that old never-ending nightmare



I remember times when skies were grey

Innocence ran through our bones

you and I had much to say

I know you'll take me home again...



Last night those cops came to arrest you

What'd you do this time? Was is far from home?

Well I've seen you twice in the last ten months

Now you're gone again, so far from home



I remember times when skies were grey

Innocence ran through our bones

you and I had much to say

I know you'll take me home, again...



I have found life, and took the time to 

never fear and sing for death

I'm not a victim, you're not the answer

I can't control my own life





We-Will-Not-Break-Look-Out-Find-Find Your Faith

The earth turns but we don't feel it move

I've found a better life, I'll promise you


Fifteen I'm strung out 

once again and kicked out 

I think well I'm on my own, 

I'm on my own now, 

sixteen and I said goodbye 

to those I knew I'll never see 

well I can't see home 

I cant see home now 

when I look at the path 

That I chose and I'll say to you

Live Fast Die Young 

we'll stay out on the run 

so live fast and die young

Live Fast Die Young 

we'll stay out on the run

so live fast and die young

Seventeen I'm sleepin on the 

streets and no hope 

I think well I'm in the cold 

I'm in the cold now, 

I look to a god I said 

in my own life 

I'll never see well 

I can't see home 

I can't see home now 

when I look at the path 

that I chose and I'll say to you.

Live Fast Die Young 

we'll stay out on the run 

so live fast and die young

Live Fast Die Young 

we'll stay out on the run 

so live fast and die young

We'll cherish every moment last forever

We'll cherish every moment now

We'll cherish every moment last forever

We'll cherish every moment now

Go Go Go Go 

Live fast and die young


I got your letter, read that mom was gone

(Mom was gone)

I never thought that dad would ever lose his mind

(Lose his mind)

I haven't slept it seems like all week long

(all week long)

And I've prayed a thousand times



To a god who doesn't take request

and all I hear is kid become the dream

Become the dream

You said it once I've heard it twice

You'll always make mistakes in life

Become the dream 



I held this letter in my hand 

and start to shake

then wonder is the end

is this the end?

I took for granted 

all the things you've given me 

I say this is the end



I'll raise my fist

Shout and scream

I wont resist this life 

Become the dream

Become the dream



I'll raise my fist

Shout and scream

I wont resist this life 

Become the dream

Become the dream


Those nights we walk together

I couldn't sleep

Well I still remember what you wore now

It was the cold december air

the way the rain hit your hair but then

I woke up from a dream I can't repair

and then realized 

how far I'd finally come

Well the damage that's been made

The hurt I've caused can never be erased

only until now

can we disappear

Now



I walked alone some nights

thinking of the time 

we laid your soul to rest

This disillusion comforts me

I wait for you sometimes 

but always feel my life

is flashing way to fast

We never had a second chance

So when was my place branded 

faithless lost again

So when was my place branded 

faithless lost my friend



I will never trust and

label death as my only defense

I will never trust again

I will never trust and

label death as my only defense

I will never love again

I still remember when your



You were found

and we were bored 

let's live 

one more time



I've made my way this life's

taken so much time to manufacture grace

I feel the darkness fall

I can remember times when so much 

Love and hate made something more than

Haste

It made me push you more

So when are we supposed to leave this place

Why you not me

So when were we supposed to climb on top of grace

From your cold hands 

and your dead eyes

From your cold

Hands I Cry



I will never trust and

label death as my only defense

I will never trust again

I will never trust and

label death as my only defense

I will never love again

I will never trust and

label death as my only defense

I will never love again

I still remember that cold december


>> otep

and eye was like 13

and it was a Sunday morning eye think



and

eye think both my parents were still asleep

eye was gonna play sick so eye wouldn't have to go to church that day





(don't stop)

(don't stop)



and eye turned over

(my beloved)

(my beloved)



holding a pillow

he smelled of sweat & regret



and he said ....

shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh


I'm sorry
I'm ugly
all that I am
and I can never live up

I'm failing
I'm angry
afraid of the ways
they pretend to be us

it's fucked up
I'm different
words remain
my only escape

art saves
all of me
evolving

and now you're walking away!!!

I'm so afraid
and now you're walking away

I'm so ashamed
and now you're walking away!!


Berrate﻿ unshat'ecat



my mistake
was trusting you

blood pigs
with creating my fate

with poetry
and suffering

I cannibalized
every ounce of my pain

I'm still afraid
everyday

these greedy worms
- they devour my plagues

I'm not your slave
I'm conquering
you see me rise

and now you're walking away!!!

I'm not ashamed!
and now you're walking away!

I'm not afraid!
and now you're walking away!!



you can't hurt me anymore
you can't hurt me anymore

fed from the wound from
which we were bled

vomiting filth in
our soft cave heads

chewing on tissue,
tendon and fat

destroying the things
they do not understand!

tyrant.
betrayer.
parasite.
traitor!!

....and still you feed them
....and still you need them

I'm sorry
I'm ugly

dangerous
can't describe it enough

I'm failing
I'm angry

I use my fear
to empower my hate

I'm fucked up
I'm different

wurdz remain
my only escape

art saves
all of me
evolving

and now you're walking away!!!

I'm not ashamed
and now you're walking away

I'm not afraid
and now you're walking away!

and now you're walking away!
and now you're walking away
and now you're walking away


Berrate﻿ unshat'ecat

my mistake!
was trusting you!

blood pigs -
with creating my fate!

with poetry
and suffering
I cannibalized....
every ounce of my pain

I'm still afraid everyday
you still suckle my plagues
I'm not your fucking slave
so why're you walking away?

blood pig!
why're you walking away?


To all u weak mcs.... all u hardcore wannabe'z

if u step into the ring be prepared to swing!! ...(WHUT??)



me be the best to impress with dictation?

too far fetched? beyond your imagination?

i'll rise to the occasion launching an invasion

-- enterin your mental like a viral infestation

wurdz be abrasive -- joints eye be lacin

sacrificin mics to ignite the celebration

its just amazing, poetically we blazing

xen & otep -- a volatile combination

(time to) -- DESTROY LIKE REVELATIONS!

styles be liquid and flow like irrigation

-- so make the preparation.........

defeat is bittersweet, its all u'll be tastin

sounding battle stations - my war face in place

total annihilation - your existence has been erased

its the renaissance - time to switch up and change

the path the paragraphs infiltrate your brain





T.R.I.C.



risin from the ashes to lead the wretched masses

back to the sufi shack - defyin all the fascists

wurdz burn with passion -- mentally enhancin

i'm david to goliath or delilah to your samson

kickin ass like cassius -- spreadin rhymes like rashes

the satellites in flight - how long before it crashes

falling like avalanches - crumbled and crushed

my wild womyn get to sinning -- know the power of us

i'm callin your bluff -- is it freedom or death?

we're gettin it on in Babylon - chokin on gods breath

the infinite connects true soldiers alive

the tribe will survive when armageddon arrives







the revolution is coming

TAKE NO PRISONERS

the revolution is coming

COWARDS BEWARE.............FUCK!



-- my war serpents rattle when its time to battle (mental midgets)

eye got a fist full of shit for u flies to feast

u lost control of your soul cuz your minds deceased

unfulfilled satisfactions & chemical reactions

my fate there's no escape -- life itself is the assassin

eye'm blastin -- the worlds in ashes -- from the invasion

--- EVERY WORD'S ANNIHILATION!!



COME ON!!







......your suffering will free u


My Confession... 

Because I'm deluded... and perfectly flawed...
I shall live by passion, and not by law.
And I'm... insecure, I... need aggression.
To... feed the spiders, of perception.
And I'm, supposed to be strong and... have all the answers.
A cannibal, in the... new Church of Cancer.

But I'm, nothing special -- I'm not unique.
I have many secrets, and I eat the weak.
And I'm... at an end.
I'm at an end...
And there's... no way out!


I need to find my sanctuary,
Some place safe.
Gotta' get this outta' me,
this is my escape.

And I... think about it all the time.
I'm volatile and afraid to cry.
But I'm... still not comfortable in my skin.
And the anesthetics, slowly... wearing thin.

And I, need to talk to... someone new.
I need a different, latitude.
And I'm... in this void all alone.
Feeling needy. Hungry to grow,
but I'm... suffocating,
Can't come down.

And... there's no way out...
There's no way out!



All I see is sadness...
All I see is sadness...
What's left?

This will teach them...
This will teach them...

You've got to push, push, push...
Your way out!

Follow me!
Follow me!
This is your way out!

This is where I hide my power.
This is where I become free.
This is where I take control,
and slowly choke your fantasies.

I want to know my day is coming,
see my enemies be punished.
Shed my skin again,
this will be my best revenge.

Shed my skin again,
This will be my best revenge.


(resurrection .. is for those ..

who didn't get it right - the first time ...)



(eternal salvation suffers from inflation!!)



sinner!







say whut u need to save your soul

but don't fuck with me - eye'm losing control



eye'm so tired of this - so sick of u

my tongue is battered & bruised from all these attitudes



(sinner)



so teach me the magick of your sacred pomes

conjuring a voice of signs & omens



prophecies guide the breeze

w/syllables symbols breed



behind the eyes we climb the vine

to sacrifice our wounded minds



in soft wurd trances seek insanity

i can't save u cuz i hate me







the lord is my weapon - i shall shoot pawns

womyn is a devil - (your) GOD IS A FRAUD

everyone u knew - everything u've ever done

suffer for your freedom - RISE & OVERCOME



(sinner!)







say whut u need to save your soul

but leave your religion at the door



we're smoking all of Krsna's weed

eye'm sick of these weak anarchies



u see me as a place to make a bruise

but in my reality eye'm a slave to the muse



fuck those hypocrites - together we'll fight

the tyranny of squares - SQUIGGLES UNITE











all u sinners

-- and blasphemers!



BURN IN THE PIT!!



SINNER!

BURN!











save me



WHY?



SALVATION!!


KUAN!!



simple souls overload as I explode data banks

'cause the earth & space gave birth to this paleface



supreme -- linguistic -- mental machine

your brain cells swell - the intellects extreme



fire fills my veins as I proclaim my resistance

to the mind-swapping parasites that feed off my existence



as I -- skin the burn to relearn the royal plan

somewhere out beyond the edges in the depths of spirit land



it's authentic, apocalyptic destroyer

damaging challengers -- resurrection, disorder



a monument of crisis - I strike this - your dead

line my nest with your soul -- cleansed in bloodshed





BATTLE READY!

poets gonna take control

BATTLE READY

souls violate parole

BATTLE READY

violently invade your home

-- breaking the bones

OF THOSE WHO OPPOSE



commanding the mic -- striking up a verb-fest

mass destruction is my function - time to put it to the test



in combat --- attacking since way back

in the days I drew praise for the way that I slain facts



formulating flows in revolutionary science

it's the catastrophic prophet from the anarchist alliance



freaking techniques -- this creature of speech

ewe feels the fury of devastation 'cause ewe ewe tasted defeat



I'm alone on my throne in this universe of fear

royalty divides my soul -- in this role I'm revered



as the pinnacle -- lyrical master -- queen of disaster

I ruin brain fluid -- the UNKNOWN IS WHAT I'M AFTER







shaking up the world -- just like the 2nd coming of Christ

-- when I write -- thrice divine with this goddess sight



words will flow -- wounds will grow

ewe knows -- bones will be exposed from the force that I unload



it's THE SOUL EATER!! -- mic bleeder with the voice of chaos

I got the nectar of the gods flowing from my mental pod



gather the flock -- alarm your block

tell them the shepherds have come & got the keys to unlock



a holy war -- through your veins it courses

more lyrical artillery than the armed forces



supernatural -- styles be volatile

it's the mind manipulator -- the WAR CHILD











COME!

SHADOW SOLDIERS!



we came to defy - living life as a lie

we embryonic satellites need our freedom to fly



TO WATCH DIE! -- agonizing cries are heard in stereo

I'm visualizing battlefield scenarios



in the line of fire -- watching empires fall

into attack position -- ELIMINATE ALL!!!



MY SPECIES!!!









MY SPECIES!

NO SURRENDER!


eye remember

suffering



eye remember

... feeling the sting



of childhood

& injections



holy bruises

sweet infections

in

a

stew

like drowning

cockroaches

Calling, calling

Where will these visions lead?

How far dare i go?

Where will this song take me?

Into the deep unknown

Yeah

Spirits, spirits

Come, come



All the prophets and the gods came prepared for theirs

So we dine on divine of the mind impaired

Preaching werewolf prayers on a nightly flight

It's taken all we ate in the pale moonlight

Feel the urge of the power surge connect us all

Bringing kingdoms under siege with the words that i control

Got an arsenal, ganja blunts and such

Only love can set me free from this patriotic quest

Speaking testaments in our secret dialogue 

While the drones begin to feast on the feces of the hog 

Walk in the wilderness of the mind

Soul decides to die and leave infinity behind



Possession, invention

Invite discovery

Surrender to pleasures

Lost in ecstasy

Survive

Alive you are my enemy

You die for lies, slave to misery



Down on the battleground

Laying wasted competition

I'm collecteng intellects and exhaling solar systems

I decree mutiny

It's revolution us against the patriarchy

The assembler of souls, full of knowledge untold

While i'm spinning webs of wisdom prophecies unfold

Into attack mode to decipher the code

Of babylon's terror spawn, tyranny reloads

Mental states apathy erases

Urgency of rage in its frightening little places

Prepare for warfare

The afterbirth of knowledge is america's nightmare

Yeah



Possession, invention

Invite discovery

Surrender to pleasures

Lost in ecstasy

Survive

Alive you are my enemy

You die for lies, slave to misery



Sometimes i sit and ask myself what have i become?

What have i become?

What... have i become?

What... have i become?

What... have i become?

What have i become?

Something's taking over me

Something's taking over me

Something's taking over me

Something's taking over me



You paint your face with the blood of the weak

Self sacrifice everyone you meet

Scream at demons in my face

Theres voices of the dead nurturing my pain

I survive, i'm alive

I render fever to watch you burn

Kill your leaders to help you learn

I survive, i'm alive


nothings changed

the senates still corrupt

& the emporer remains insane



and everyday

is a new strain of slaughter



supply lines are less protected

evil on all sides



eye can smell the death on your flesh

-- creeping in



trapped within the twisting fingers of fear

and all eye see is ewe



that face

those eyes



burning like leprosy 



eye can see u there 

poisoning the air



prostituting Nationalism



and eye want to attack

to rip out your heart and lay your flat on your back



and vomit a world of agony and truth

into your throbbing illness of memory



... and hate guides our way



eye long for the icy slap of a belt across my back

for the acceptance of death and blind cave war



the giving sleep of depression

the sweet elucidation of savage, meaningless aggression



chiseled in the meaty forearms of Mother Jupiter and his slave disciples



in the harem tents - outside

just beyond the edges - eye ride



a cycloptic mare in the fires of imagination   



feeding my disease

a river of plagues



eye need something to remind me eye am still sinning

that pain in important

that wurdz matter

that healing in possible



that eye am not alone ... in this



- guard the houses

- triple the watch

- maidens, dig up your sorcery

- sirens, sharpen your rocks



... ewe will eat my pain again



whatever u need

unite messiah ME


Lying naked alone

On the bathroom floor

Evacuating pain... fear

NO MORE!



And I can't get his scent off of me



She wants to be a messiah

Without the crucifixion

She wants to fuck delilah

Without samson's Intervention

She wants to be a deity and rule us everyday

And punish the wars of your rich gods and the martyrs that they slay

She wants to see galaxies

All the planets and the stars

She wants to be a fallen angel without the swollen scars



Unclean

Unclean

Fillthee

And I can't get his scent off of me

Unclean

Unclean

Fillthee

And I can't get his scent off of me



She wants to free the kingdom

Be worshipped by the earth

She wants to be the prophet

For ten times what shes worth

She wants to break free from eve

And leave them all behind

To be born again in the thrill of sin

And revive her dying mind

She wants to stand

Rape the King

Slaughter the daughter kill everything

Burn the world and let her soul be free

Ignite the nebulas of eternity



Unclean

Unclean

Fillthee

And I can't get his scent off of me

Unclean

Unclean

Fillthee

And I can't get his scent off of me



Don't touch me there

Oh, I know you're scared

Kill the need in me

And I remain



Unclean

Unclean

Fillthee

And I can't get his scent off of me

Unclean

Unclean

Fillthee

And I can't get his scent off of me



Why should I be afraid?

It's not the first time I've tasted pain

Why should I be afraid?

It's not the first time I've tasted pain



And I can't get his scent off of me

"Affection not dissection,
Meat is murder,
Animals are for petting."
Oh shut the fuck up already.

I'm tired of you whining,
About poor little animals dying,
And the food they are supplying.
Because if a big animal had the chance,
It wouldn't take another glance,
It would eat you up.

"Affection not dissection,
Meat is murder,
Animals are for petting."
Oh shut your trap already.

I don't want to listen,
And I'm tired of your bitchin,
About what's in my kitchen.
Because if a big animal had the chance,
It wouldn't take another glance,
It will eat you up.


Don't even try to tell us,

What we can and cannot say.

Profanity's a tool that,

You cannot take away.

Is freedom of expression,

Just a load of shit?

Just another farce in

American politics.


I've got to get out of,

I've got to get out of this hood,

I've got to get out of this neighborhood,

I've got to get out of it,

Got to get out.



I've had enough, won't call their bluff,

I'm not going to live in fear.

Racism lives on both sides so,

I'm gonna get the hell out of here.



"Do you want crack?,

Do you need smack on the track?,

Do you want grass?,

Smoke hash you white trash?"



You better watch out,

You better watch out,

You better watch out,

Watch out



I've had it up to here,

I'm not gonna live in fear.

They're the ones who are racist, not me

Why can't they just let me be


Why do I keep scratching,
Scratching my balls?
I don't like this feeling,
I don't like it at all.

Cause I got crabs,
I got crabs,
I got crabs,
I got those little fuckers biting and sucking my blood.

There's crab eggs in my bed,
They're in the carpet too,
I'll go to the store,
Buy A200 shampoo.
I got R.I.D. of them,
I got all of them,
They won't be back,
Wait a second,
What is this itching in my crack?

Cause I got crabs,
I got crabs,
I got crabs,
I got those little fuckers biting and sucking my blood.


I play pool,

Cause I'm no fool.

I play pool,

Cause I'm cool.

I play pool after school,

I play pool all the time.



Cue in my left hand, beer in right.

I shoot and drink all through the night

That sloppy english does me just right

I use that sloppy english all the time



I hold my stick,

Like I hold my dick.

Hustling beers from wetto

That's the trick.



I use that sloppy english,

All the time.


Hey you, you have too much hair,

And we don't like what you wear,

And you have really bad breath,

So were gonna beat you to death.



Because there is plenty of us,

And only one of you,

We've got plenty of reasons,

And here's just a few,



You put your chocolate in my peanut butter,

I was walking and you were in my way,

You looked at me without my permission,

And never even apologized.



You put your chocolate in my peanut butter,

That's good enough reason for me to bash.

You put your chocolate in my peanut butter,

That's good enough reason for me to smash.



No justice (There's just us)



You put your chocolate in my peanut butter,

You put your chocolate in my peanut butter,

You put your chocolate in my peanut butter,

You put your chocolate in my peanut butter.


My name is Mister Jones,

I get inside your bones,

I know how to make you tweek,

You soon will be my freak.



Because I know what you need,

I control your mind,

I roll up your sleeves,

I make ties that bind,

I've got you!



You'll soon be begging on your knees,

You've got the disease,

All your money belongs to me,

You've got the disease.



I can't seem to live without you,

Without you whats the point,

I wasn't born with a silver burnt spoon,

Do I still have any choice? (NO!)



Because I know what you need,

I control your mind,

I roll up your sleeves,

I make ties that bind.


I don't want tofu,

I'd rather have a mouthful of beef stew,

I don't want to be vegetarian,

Why eat beans when you can have steak instead?



I don't feel bad about,

Eating something that's dead,

So why should I be sad,

For cows getting hit in the head?

So I like eating fish,

Tell me what's wrong with this,

How can you blame me,

For eating chicken of the sea?



Don't waste your breath yelling at me,

About animal rights,

And how they should be free,

It's survival of the fittest,

And we're winning.



I don't feel bad about,

Eating something thats dead,

So why should I be sad,

For chickens being force fed,

So I like eating fish,

Tell me what's wrong with this,

How can you blame me,

For eating chicken of the sea?


If I want some beer,

I don't want to hear,

How I missed the show,

Because I drink to slow,

So pass me the beer bong,

It won't take very long,

For me to put down,

Torpedo to the ground.



Because drinking beer's to slow,

Beer bong's the way to go,

To go,

To go,

Don't drink, too slow



Beer Bong, Beer Bong, Beer Bong, Beer Bong



If I want some beer,

I don't want to hear,

How I missed the show,

Because drinking beer's to slow,

Beer bong's the way to go,

Beer Bong, Beer Bong, Drink it down now.


You fight for peace,

But where's the war?

What the fuck are doing this for?

You say disarment, that's the key,

Well that's not they way it looks to me.



You wear your leather jacket,

But you won't eat meat.

Piece punk, get drunk, spike your hair,

Go out, hang out, do you really care?

There's no easy answers,

Complaining won't do shit,

If you want some changes,

Don't be a hypocrite.



Fuck the system,

That's what they say,

But they live by it everyday,

Food stamps and welfare checks,

Would you rather starve to death?



You wear a leather jacket,

But you won't eat meat.

Piece punk, get drunk, spike your hair,

Go out, hang out, do you really care?

Don't you feel ridiculous now?

Half your wardrobe comes from a cow,

Do you believe in anarchy?

Who are you really trying to be?


>> greenday

Hey there lookin' at me
Tell me what do you see
But you quickly turn your head away
Try to find the words I could use
Don't have the courage to come up to you
My chance is looking a bit grey

Staring across the room
Are you leaving soon?
I just need a little time

What is it that drives me mad
Girls like you that I never had
What is it about you that I adore?
What makes me feel so much pain?
That makes me go so insane
What is it about you that I adore?

Staring across the room
Are you leaving soon?
I just need a little time (what time, ah!)

Why did you have to leave so soon?
Why did you have to walk away?
Oh, well, it happened again
She walked away with her boyfriend
Maybe we'll meet again someday.
Maybe we'll meet again someday.
Maybe we'll meet again someday.
Someday


I'll go for miles

Till I find you

You say you want to leave me

But you can't choose

I've gone thru pain

Every day and night

I feel my mind is going insane

Something I can't fight



Don't leave me

Don't leave me



A blank expression

Covering your face

I'm looking for directions

For out of this place

I start to wonder

If you'll come back

I feel the rain storming after thunder

I can't hold back



Don't leave me



I'll go for miles

Till I find you

You say you want to leave me

But you can't choose

I've gone thru pain

Every day and night

I feel my mind is going insane

Something I can't fight



Don't leave me


Looking back upon my life

And the places that I've been

Pictures, faces, girls I've loved

I try to remember when

Faded memories on the wall

Some names I have forgotten

But each one is a memory I

Look back on so often.



I look into the past

I want to make it last

I was there



I look into the past

I want to make it last

I was there



Looking back what I have done

There's lots more life to live

At times I feel overwhelmed

I question what I can give

But I don't let it get me down

Or cause me too much sorrow

There's no doubt about who I am

I always have tomorrow



I look into the past

I want to make it last

I was there



I look into the past

I want to make it last

I was there



Looking back upon my life

Faded memories on the wall

Looking now at who I am

I don't let it get me down.

I look into the past

Now you see me, now you don't

Don't ask me where I'm at

'Cause I'm a million miles away

Treated like a forbidden heel

Don't say my thoughts are not for real

Or you won't see me again



Am I here or am I there

Or am I playing on the stairs

Am I in my room with my toys

I am the disappearing boy



When I walk in crowded rooms

I feel as if it is my doom

I know that I don't belong

In that room I see her

I see her and she's with him

I turn and then I'm gone



Don't call me up 'cause I'm not home

My whereabouts are now unknown

I vanished from all your joy

I'm the disappearing boy



I have my doubts

Of where I belong

It's something to think about



Don't call me up 'cause I'm not home

My whereabouts are now unknown

I vanished from all your joy

I'm the disappearing boy


A small cloud has fallen

The white mist hits the ground

My lungs comfort me with joy

Vegging on one detail

The rest just crowds around

My eyes itch of burning red



Picture sounds

Of moving insects so surreal

Lay around

Looks like I found something new



Laying in my bed

I think I'm in left field

I picture someone, I think it's you

You're standing so damn close

My body begins to swell

Why does 1 + 1 make 2

Here we go again, infatuation

Touches me just when I

Thought that it would end

Oh but then again it seems

Much more than that but

I'm not sure exactly what you're thinking



Well,I toss and turn all night

Thinking of your ways of effection

But to find that it's not different at all

I throw away my past mistakes

And contemplate my future

That's when I say...

What the hey!



Would I last forever?

You and I together, hand and hand

We run away (far away)

I'm in for nasty weather

But I'll take whatever you can

give that comes my way (far away)

Every night I dream the same dream
Of getting older and older all the time
I ask you now, what does this mean?
Are these problems just in my mind?
Things are easy when you're a child
But now these pressures have dropped on my head
The length I've gone are just long miles
Would they be shorter if I were dead?

Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair?

Look at my friends and see what they've done
Ask myself why they've had to change
I like them better when they were young
Now all these times are rearranged
I look down and stand there and cry
Nothing ever will be the same
The sun is rising, now I ask why?
The clouds now fall and here comes the rain

Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair?

Every night I dream the same dream
Of getting older and older all the time
I ask you now, what does this mean?
Are these problems just in my mind?
Things are easy when you're a child
But now these pressures have dropped on my head
The length I've gone are just long miles
Would they be shorter if I were dead?

Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair?


I always waste my time just wondering

What the next man thinks of me

I'll never do exactly what I want

And I'll sculpt my life for your acceptance



I always waste my time just wondering

What the next man thinks of me

I'll never do exactly what I want

And I'll sculpt my life for your acceptance



And I feel forgotten

Feel like rotting

(Do you feel the same?)

(Do you feel the same?)

Adolescence

Just can't make sense

(It's calling my name)

(It's calling my name)



I take a look around

And all the things I've found

I call it blind hatred

If you'd stop a while

And maybe if you'd smile

You would realize that

We're all the same



It's just like our brain

When it goes insane

We feel the same pain



All my life I've seemed to have this need

I think at times it even turns to greed

We all want to join some family

We'll even sacrifice a moral changing



And I feel forgotten

Feel like rotting

(Do you feel the same?)

Adolescence

Just can't make sense

Hey can you hear me?

I'm calling your name

Hello?  Or is this goodbye?

The gleam in your eyes

It troubles my brain

Will I see it again?

So I can rest my head



Angel...Angel!  Dancing away

As all of my thoughts get rearranged

Angel...Angel!  Turning away

Just when thing seem

To have changed

So I can rest my head



Hey can you hear me?

I'm calling your name

Hello?  Or is this goodbye?

The gleam in your eyes

It troubles my brain

Will I see it again?

So I can rest my head


Princess in a school girl's dream

May I please speak with you?

I'm having troubles with control

And it's all because of you

Today I kept on falling down

I thought it was the street

So I look down at my shoes

They were on the wrong feet



I find it hard to be myself

(Can you please explain?)

I do not think that it's my health

(You're the one to blame)

You're the one I wish I had

And now my girlfriend is getting mad

(I cannot call this sane)



Today as I was walking down

You bumped into me

You said "excuse me" and walked away

As I dropped to my knees

I prayed to the being in the sky

That my parents told me of

I asked about you but no reply

No clues about your love!



I find it hard to be myself

(Can you please explain?)

I do not think that it's my health

(You're the one to blame)

My girlfriend left me on the phone

I'm pathetically left here alone

(I cannot call this sane)



Can we find a way

So that you can stay

I think I'm gonna Pop

way some other day, life is what you make it 

that's what some say just go away, i don't want to 

hear it i'm confused i'm not amused, right now 

i'm incoherent i'm not on my own still i'm alone, 



i should have seen it coming i didn't want to see 

i can see us breaking permanently! 

I guess it's out of my hands that's exactly what i hate 



there's one thing left to turn to it's not a girl and it's not the world, 

when everyone has their own thing 

he's into you and he loves you too. he's 

what keeps me going when i'm afraid any my beds not made. 

Still I haven't forgotten that they're over there and 

i'm right here. i might not always be here.


Light my path show me 

the way filter everything 

i say try to forgive try 

to forget why do i do what 

i regret? my flesh nature 

won't abide its ripping 

me apart inside Jesus 

pulls me back together 

my soul will be with him 

forever can't get away 

from bitterness can't 

seem to lose my 

selfishness my faith in father 

God cause i am 

weak and he is strong!


i need the kind of girl that knows 

a girl that likes to wear my clothes 

someone who always buys me coke 

someone who laughs at all my jokes 

that's the girl that i want to see 

fall in love with me 

that's the girl that i long to know 

oh how i love her so 

i'm looking for a girl who writes me songs 

and talks to Jesus all day long

and the way she does her hair 

no one else can compare 

i'll probably meet her at a show 

when i look at her i'll know 

that she's the perfect one for me 

and with her i will always be 

the one for me


intimidation has put me thru what i need to 

stand up to you don't protest i've made up 

my mind i've got to leave it all behind i 

believed so many times your deceit too 

many lies my hope for you in decadence 

can't replace what's torn apart it took me 

such a long time to realize i was an instutution 

for you go where you want to go know who 

you want to know now i know that i was 

lied to sometimes i see your lighter side 

the part of you try to hide it's true you 

still don't seem to care never a word only 

a stare no one has ever known you you 

don't even know yourself your best friend's 

your enemy too what else can i say to you 

it took me such a long time to realize i was 

an instutution for you go where you want 

to go know who you want to know now i know 

that i was lied to


it tears me apart inside i know 

think twice it tears me apart inside i know 

i do it too you can run but you can't hide 

deep down i find you so it seems it's no big deal 

we don't think about it much a pain created a 

pain that's real i've got the scars to prove it 

when we tear each other down what's our 

intentions? it's always more that just a joke 

so let's try to think twice-so think twice! it's 

true we are a brotherhood and we all know it 

bonded by the son of God is how we live-so think twice!


we're all walkin' down a dusty road i 

wouldn't care to bear the load i 

know my limits but you won't leave 

my alone it's a system unopposed 

for those of us who won't say no your 

time is your own now face the facts 

are real establishing lines always 

comes first many don't realize 

the pain they cause


every now and then i get 

time alone so my 

solitude gives me time to 

roam through my ideals i 

excogitate how i see the 

world and how it sees me 

sentence me all alone i 

won't be on my own 

take me as i am in 

support of a populist 

implicate yoursef those 

who are impious i'm 

disassociated for more 

than just one reason 

don't discount my 

feelings for the truth


right now there's 

nothing left for me to 

say now you want me to 

go away heard it one to 

many times now it's 

swimming in your mind 

you don't know how you 

should feel can't decide 

if what's real is real how 

does the faith come so 

easily why believe in 

what you can't see? 

i feel so bad have i done 

all i can? want to give 

you more don't know 

what i can have you ears 

to hear what is said to you 

have you eyes to see 

the light that's shining on 

you

your bad hair day bad

told me to go away i

bad hair day bad hair day 

would you like an aspirin 

for your bad hair day bad

night just thinking about 

the day that you'll be 

here everything's gonna 

be alright when i'm 

thinking about holding 

you near will you look 

away from me? please 

don't look away from me 

i'm gonna sit and 

consider flowers i'm 

gonna sit and think for 

hours

way i see it in my mind is 

you are here and there 

you're gonna sit will you 

look away from me?

expectations did i miss 

the way you felt for me 

or did you ever want for 

this to be?


>> weezer

My name is Jonas

I'm carrying the wheel

Thanks for all you've shown us

But this is how we feel

Come sit next to me

Pour yourself some tea

Just like grandma made

When we couldn't find sleep

Things were better then

Once but never again

We've all left the den

Let me tell you 'bout it 



The choo-choo train left right on time

A ticket costs only your mind

The driver said, 'Hey man, we go all the way'

Of course we were willing to pay 



My name is Wepeel

I gotta box full of your toys

They're fresh out of batteries

But they're still makin' noise (makin' noise)

Tell me what to do

Now the tank is dry

Now this wheel is flat

And you know what else?

Guess what I received

In the mail today

Words of deep concern

From my little brother 



The building's not going as he planned

The foreman has injured his hand

The dozer will not clear a path

The driver swears he learned his math 



The workers are going home

The workers are going home

The workers are going home

The workers are going home

Yeah! 



The workers are going home

The workers are going home

The workers are going home

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 



My name is Jonas


My girl's got a big mouth

With which she blabbers a lot

She laughs at most everything

Whether it's funny or not

And if you see her

Tell her it's over now 



I want a girl who will laugh for no one else

When I'm away she puts her makeup on the shelf

When I'm away she never leaves the house

I want a girl who laughs for no one else 



My girl's got eyeballs

In the back of her head

She looks around and around

You know it makes me sad to see her like that

Please don't believe her - she says that for anyone

And if you see her

Tell her it's a hey hey hey hey 



I want a girl who will laugh for no one else

When I'm away she puts her makeup on the shelf

When I'm away she never leaves the house

I want a girl who laughs for no one else 



And if you see her

Tell her it's over now 



And if you see her

Tell her it's over now 



And if you watch her go (watch her go)

Watch her, watch her, watch her, watch her! 



I want a girl who will laugh for no one else

When I'm away she puts her makeup on the shelf

When I'm away she never leaves the house

I want a girl who laughs for no one else, no one else


The world has turned and left me here

Just where I was before you appeared

And in your place an empty space

Has filled the void behind my face 



I just made love with your sweet memory

One thousand times in my head

You said you loved it more than ever

You said 



You remain turned away

Turning further every day 



The world has turned and left me here

Just where I was before you appeared

And in your place an empty space

Has filled the void behind my face 



I talked for hours to your wallet photograph

And you just listened

You laughed enchanted by intellect

Or maybe you didn't 



You remain turned away

Turning further every day 



The world has turned and left me here

Just where I was before you appeared

And in your place an empty space

Has filled the void behind my face 



You remain, turned away

Turning further every day 



The world has turned and left me here

Just where I was before you appeared

And in your place, an empty space

Has filled the void behind my face 



Do you believe what I sing now?

Do you believe what I sing now?

Do you believe? 



Do you believe what I sing now?

Do you believe what I sing now?

Do you believe?


What's with these homies, dissing my girl?

Why do they gotta front?

What did we ever do to these guys

That made them so violent?

Woo-hoo, but you know I'm yours

Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine

Woo-hoo, and that's for all time 



Oo-ee-oo I look just like Buddy Holly

Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore

I don't care what they say about us anyway

I don't care bout that 



Don't you ever fear, I'm always near

I know that you need help

Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit

You need a guardian

Woo-hoo, and you know I'm yours

Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine

Woo-hoo, and that's for all time 



Oo-ee-oo I look just like Buddy Holly

Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore

I don't care what they say about us anyway

I don't care bout that

I don't care bout that 



Bang, bang a knock on the door

Another big bang and you're down on the floor

Oh no! What do we do?

Don't look now but I lost my shoe

I can't run and I can't kick

What's a matter babe are you feeling sick?

what's a matter, what's a matter, what's a matter you?

What's a matter babe, are you feeling blue? oh-oh!

And that's for all time

And that's for all time 



Oo-ee-oo I look just like Buddy Holly

Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore

I don't care what they say about us anyway

I don't care bout that

I don't care bout that

I don't care bout that

I don't care bout that

Lying on the floor (lying on the floor)

I've come undone

Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked

Lying on the floor (lying on the floor)

I don't want to destroy your tank-top

Let's be friends and just walk away

It's good to see you lying there in your Superman skivvies

Lying on the floor (lying on the floor)

The sea is foaming like a bottle of beer

The wave is coming but I ain't got no fear

I'm waxing down so that I'll go real fast

I'm waxing down because it's really a blast

I'm going surfin cos I don't like your face

I'm bailing out because I hate the race

Of rats that run round and round in the maze

I'm going surfing, I'm going surfing! 



You take your car to work

I'll take my board

And when you're out of fuel

I'm still afloat 



My buddies and their honeys all come along

They seem invincible as they surf along

The sea is rolling like a thousand pound keg

We're going surfing, we're going surfing! 



You take your car to work

I'll take my board

And when you're out of fuel

I'm still afloat 



You take your car to work

I'll take my board

And when you're out of fuel

I'm still afloat 



All along the undertow

Is strengthening it's hold

I never thought it would come to this

Now I can never go home

Oh yeah

Somebody's Heine'

Is crowdin' my icebox

Somebody's cold one

Is givin' me chills

Guess I'll just close my eyes 



Oh yeah

Alright

Feels good

Inside 



Flip on the tele

Wrestle with Jimmy

Something is bubbling

Behind my back

The bottle is ready to blow 



Say it ain't so

Your drug is a heartbreaker

Say it ain't so

My love is a life taker 



I can't confront you

I never could do

That which might hurt you

So try and be cool

When I say

This way is a waterslide away from me

That takes you further every day

So be cool 



Say it ain't so

Your drug is a heartbreaker

Say it ain't so

My love is a life taker 



Dear Daddy

I write you in spite of years of silence

You've cleaned up, found Jesus, things are good or so I hear

This bottle of Steven's awakens ancient feelings

Like father, stepfather, the son is drowning in the flood

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 



Say it ain't so

Your drug is a heartbreaker

Say it ain't so

My love is a life taker


I've got a Dungeon Master's Guide

I've got a 12-sided die

I've got Kitty Pryde

And Nightcrawler too

Waiting there for me

Yes I do, I do 



I've got posters on the wall

My favorite rock group KISS

I've got Ace Frehley

I've got Peter Criss

Waiting there for me

Yes I do, I do 



I've got an electric guitar

I play my stupid songs

I write these stupid words

And I love every one

Waiting there for me

Yes I do, I do 



In the garage

I feel safe

No one cares about my ways

In the garage

Where I belong

No one hears me sing this song

In the garage

In the garage 



In the garage

I feel safe

No one cares about my ways

In the garage

Where I belong

No one hears me sing this song

In the garage

I feel safe

No one laughs about my ways

In the garage

Where I belong

No one hears me

No one hears me

No one hears me

No one hears me

No one hears me sing this song


Let's go away for a while

You and I

To a strange and distant land

Where they speak no word of truth

But we don't understand anyway 



Holiday

Far away

To stay

On a holiday

Far away

Let's go today

In a heartbeat! 



Heartbeat

Heartbeat 



Don't bother to pack your bags

Or your map

We won't need them where we're going

We're going where the wind is blowing

Not knowing where we're gonna stay 



Holiday

Far away

To stay

On a holiday

Far away

Let's go today

In a heartbeat! 



Heartbeat

Heartbeat

Heartbeat

Heartbeat 



We will write a postcard

To our friends and family

In free verse

On the road with Kerouac

Sheltered in his Bivouac

On this road we'll never die... 



Heartbeat

Heartbeat 



Let's go away for a while

You and I

To a strange and distant land

Where they speak no word of truth

But we don't understand anyway 



Holiday

Far away

To stay

On a holiday

Far away

To stay

On a holiday! 



Let's go away

Let's go away

On a holiday

Let's go away

Let's go away

In a heartbeat


You can't resist her

She's in your bones

She is your marrow

And your ride home

You can't avoid her

She's in the air (in the air)

In between molecules

Of oxygen and carbon dioxide 



Only in dreams

We see what it means

Reach out our hands

Hold on to hers

But when we wake

It's all been erased

And so it seems

Only in dreams 



You walk up to her

Ask her to dance

She says, 'Hey baby

I just might take the chance'

You say, 'It's a good thing

That you float in the air (in the air)

That way there's no way

I will crush your pretty

Toenails into a thousand pieces.' 



Only in dreams

We see what it means

Reach out our hands

Hold on to hers

But when we wake

It's all been erased

And so it seems

Only in dreams 



Only in dreams...

Only in dreams...

Only in dreams...

Only in dreams...

Only in dreams...

Only in dreams...

Is it just a car or is it so much more? It's a superstar with the gas to the floor. Zero to sixty in remarkable time. Its the automobile that's top of the line. We got a k car on the road of life. We're gonna get far if the driver's Christ. Is it just a car or is it so much more? It's a superstar with the gas to the floor. In a drag race all the others fall and Brandon Ebel just gave us a call.


Chillin' at the lair.

Snarf, me and the twins.

My favorite feline is the one who wore cheetah skins.

Fighting evil, we drink milk, and we purr a lot.

Ask me to cross them, and I would say I'd rather not.

Thundercats Ho!

I'm Lion-O!

Sword of Omens, come to me.

Your eye opens so you can see.

Fly from the sheath into my paw.

I am the greatest Thundercat of them all...

I'm Lion-O!


Cause it hasn't been that long

since you almost hit the tree.

Cause it hasn't been that long

since you hit the pole because of speed.



Do you remember

the ambulance it took you there?

Do you remember

they cut your pants your favorite pair?

They shaved your head.

Where's all your hair.



The doctor said,

"We need some staples for his head."

The doctor said,

"Another foot you could be dead."

The doctor said,

"We need some staples for his head."

The doctor said,

"You should have took the bus instead."



All you could hear

was kachunk, kachunk, kachunk.

All you could hear

was the doctor putting staples in this punk.





He could have died that day.

Which means that he would not be here.

He would have gone away,

friends and family we'd shed our tears.

But the good thing would be

is that we would always know.

He would be living

with Jesus Christ in his new home.




Walk through the streets of PA and you may see her.

Go up to her and say you're a believer.

Disgusting trash on MTV it makes her smile.

That guy from Satan's embassy put him on trial.



Because... Marilyn Manson ate my girlfriend.

Satan consumed her mind, and he may do it again.

Marylin Manson ate my girlfriend.

She once believed in the truth, now she believes in sin.



She denies God when she has the chance to live for him.

The thought of it makes me cringe.

Her future looks dim.

She'd rather gaze in Satan's eyes than on a steeple.

I'm really starting to despise beautiful people.


Once apon a time I dreamt that you were mine. But I never expected that dream to come true. And now you're in my arms, and we're walking to your home. And all I can think about is you. Hey, do you have to go away just yet? Hey wait I think I really must confess that you looked really good last night. Last night. Last night. We talked about this think that only God could bring into our lonely lives. And you and I've just seen we fit together perfectly. And now I'm doin' alright. Hey, do you have to go away just yet? Hey wait I think I really must confess that you looked really good last night. Last night. Last night. Last night. Last night. Last night. Last night.


New boy in the neighborhood

Lives down stairs and it's understood.

He's there just to take good care of me.

Like he's one of the family. 



Charles in charge of

Our days and our nights.

Charles in charge of

Our wrongs and our rights.

So I say

I want Charles in charge of me. 



Charles, I love you,

Love you till the end.

And I love Buddy,

Cause he's your best friend.

Let's go hang out,

You me and Jesus at your mom's pizza parlor.

And maybe you can hook me up

With the girl that's from Baywatch

And on your show.


Find it funny when the punch-line was You. And You don't like my punk boy attitude. You didn't smile when I checked out that girl, or when my sin kept me in the world. And then I claim all I wanna do is praise Your name. I hate my sin, destroy it and mold in me from within. And then I claim all I wanna do is praise Your name. I hate my sin, destroy it and mold in me from within. And now I'm trying to keep the bad stuff away, but if I forget to keep Your word and pray. I love You Jesus, I need Your love in my life. I love You Jesus, I want to be like You Christ. And now I'm trying to keep the bad stuff away, but if I forget to keep Your word and pray. I love You Jesus, I need Your love in my life. I love You Jesus, I want to be like You Christ.


Sometimes in a crowd we get talkin' real loud. Making fun of weird folks, turn their lives into jokes. I don't think it's fair when we start not to care. I think it's a shame, because we live in Jesus' name. We dance the night away, making fun of everybodies clothes. We drink the night away, and we pray that no one will ever know our insecurities. They make us act all big and bad. We're never sure of these. Lots of lip, and make ya' not be rad. You dance the night away, making fun of everybodies clothes. You drink the night away, and you pray that no one will ever know your insecurities. They make you act all big and bad. You're never sure of these. Lots of lip, and make ya' not be rad.


Am I at the point of no improvement?

What of the death I still dwell in?

I try to excel, but I feel no movement.

Can I be free of this unreleasable sin?





Never underestimate my Jesus.

You're telling me that there's no hope.

I'm telling you your wrong.



Never underestimate my Jesus

When the world around you crumbles

He will be strong, He will be strong



I throw up my hands

"Oh, the impossibilities"

Frustrated and tired

Where do I go from here?

Now I'm searching for the confidence I've lost so willingly

Overcoming these obstacles is overcoming my fear







I think I can't, I think I can't

But I think you can, I think you can

I think I can't, I think I can't

But I think you can, I think you can

Gather my insufficiencies and

place them in your hands, place them in your hands, place them in your hands


My life's been torn apart, stripped down and going nowhere. I don't know where to start, and where to go from there. It gets tough to follow you where I get scared. That I might take a spill me in faith. We agure a lot. If I will will it be Your will or will it not. God I need You, here I need You now to help me through. I think it's clear You know just how to do what You're gonna do. I am feeling quite content. I will reign in Your testiment. Sure of what I see blind of, my guidence is Your everlasting love. God I need You, here I need You now to help me through. I think it's clear You know just how to do what You're gonna do. Yeah Yeah Yeah.


>> newfoundglory

as if my existence reflects these walls so proudly intentions 

of the past defined so quickly it's hard to change myself

never put the blame on anybody's head but mine i'm still searching 

for my pride i'll keep searching but there's so many places 

for it to hide i try i've tried so hard to change for you

that i'm in well you know i'm trying so hard to live my life without you 

and i tried so hard i got you now inside my heart it kills fueled by your love 

in the end i'll call your name i'm letting go it's time for you to know 

that all this time i've been so wrong i'm letting go the time's more fast 

than slow and everything is there for you well you know 

when i go away from you i lose control 

my body is feeling cold like a winter day then i close my eyes a picture 

so clear then i close my eyes


looking back now i see how far i've gone it's been a while now 

for only one song past intentions i never ever meant to deal with now 

well just by looking around i don't think that i'll ever come down 

well you know right now that i am trying to change but believe now 

i'll try to change everything you know that i could rearrange 

and it gets harder and harder now well you know i want to change the past 

past intentions i never ever meant to deal with just by looking around 

well you know i tried so hard to change right now well just by looking around 

well i don't think that i'll ever come down all the way down


well i started all alone and i watched you grow 

and now please don't take this away from me you rise 

then you fall sometimes it seems like you're not there 

at all but that's the way it should be well take me for example 

and erase your opinions about me only time will tell where will you be 

where have you gone two years of my life now it's all gone


it's three in the morning and i stayed up all night drowning in my words 

writing about you time seems to standstill since the day you left me 

a revolving door slamming this time so slowly you're running out 

you're running fast now 

we were just kids back then two years of my life traded for an ending like this 

like a love movie without a goodbye kiss 

why was it me with all sincerity which car drove us to drove us to this road 

this road of broken promises first it was broken glass 

that fell down from the sky so fast it hit us then she promised 

but it happened again


The needle on my record player has been wearing thin

This record has been playing since the day you've been with him

No more long rides home

No more of your station

I didn't like it anyways

Remember the time we wrote our names upon the wall

Remember the time we realized "Thriller" was our favorite song





Have I waited too long

Have I found that someone

Have I waited too long to see you



Maybe it's for the best

Maybe it's not for anything

It wouldn't be so bad to take this right from me

No more long rides home

No more of your station

I didn't like it anyway

Remember the time we wrote our names upon the wall

Remember the time we realized "Thriller" was our favorite song





Have I waited too long

Have I found that someone

Have I waited too long to see you



How many times I've tried

It's simple to you, so simple to lie

How many times I've tried

Blatant mistakes of your design



How many times I've tried

It's simple to you, so simple to lie

Blatant mistakes of your design



Have I waited too long

Have I found that someone

Have I wanted too long to see you



I've had so many chances

Turn my back and I ran away

I've had so many chances to see you


distance means nothing to me it only makes me want to see you longer my words 

just like a mentioned kiss with every letter they are growing stronger days go 

by feelings, they go on unfortunately, 

without you it will never snow in florida it's best to take your time conversation 

cuts like glass i'm the calm before the storm i'm the second before the crash 

i've been between myself for days i'm the hero of the year.


pick up the pieces that i've left behind i woke up today feeling older 

and never so much better i know i talk in circles 

i never wanted to avoid your conversation you see yourself in my eyes 

another day has passed us by the more time i spend, 

the less i see of you i'll never take it back your voice is like an angel 

guiding over every move i make i'll never want it back the direction 

that you've gave me nothing can replace what i've gained time grabs me 

by the shoulders no one know how it feels to move over i know 

i'm still far from you and it feels like i'm still far from home 

my name is a disappointment i only disappoint myself 

if only i could hold this moment kept away from everyone else.


my heart is pumping for one reason maybe it's my imagination, 

but it's true it's all in your hands i no longer have this on my shoulders oh no, 

it must be something i said love is another word for regret you know, 

it must be part of my plan it's never too late to understand and i wanted it to be 

something more than just another run-around for me and even though.. 

i'm glad that i'm finally free all that's left for my life is now up to me 

and i walk around for days and i only see you in my dreams wait for me 

like i've waited for you.


your eyes, 

the blue stare surrounds me they only make you stronger still feeling this way 

won't get you anywhere your hands, they offer me to hold them lips kiss, 

they trick me into showing them but sure i want to, 

still i'm loud, as far as i can tell fast times, 

fast rides, fast cars could take me down to the direction, 

the reflection that you bring i've bee scared too long to show you how i feel.


>> lessthanjake

Now listen up and hear what i'm saying

If he's not talking to himself

Then he must be praying

Shine my shoes and ask for a dime

Then pick my pockets while i'm in line

He keeps telling me the score

Down at the liquor store


Something that's inside of me

It's something that I cannot see

Like rules and regulations

Passed down for generations

I wish I had my very own flag,

And as I walk away

I can hear you say

I wish that I had my own flag


Well I really don't know
if it matters at all so
but we try to keep the prices low
for our records and our shows
but is that
is that enough
or is (it) that we're not punk enough
or is (it) that you think ska just sucks
(but) Johnny Quest, he thinks we're what?


Johnny Quest thinks we're sellouts, sellouts
Johnny Quest thinks we're sellin' out, (we're) sellin' out, yeah
Johnny Quest thinks we're sellouts, sellouts
Johnny, yeah

Well I really don't know
if it matters at all so
but we try to keep the prices low
for our records and our shows
does it matter
that you see our shirts
besides going to school and going to work
or that you think that ska just sucks
Johnny Quest, he thinks we're what?



(He thinks we're sellin' out
sellin' out 
yeah
sellin' out 
yeah)


Wonder what hold things together

Is it political positions or maybe superstitions

The list goes on forever

It seems to go on forever

Are old rituals necessary to stand by

How many things just to get us through the night

And can we say their wrong altogether

The world keeps going on forever

It still looks big

Can everything in some way help us understand

From mathematical problems to rubber bands

And can we say it's wrong altogether

The world goes on forever

It still looks big


There was a kid so low, he couldn't stand up

No money, no respect and too much bad luck

Desperation had gotten to him at last

It was dark

Dark alley and a shot gun blast

And I knew a man everyone thought

Was out of his mind

He had a cane and seemed to be around all the time

And it's a shame, when a car rolls past

It was dark

Dark alley and a shot gun blast

Shotgun - no one ever thinks about it

Until your out of your head


If only my problems were like water

they could be boiled away

and watching the steam drift upward,

watching my problems drift away.

And watch the steam turn and twist,

watch it all drift away.

Look how it rises and lifts

watch my problems drift away.

If only my problems were like water

they all could be washed away

and watch the water go downward

watch it all go down the drain.


Two days before his mom moved him

To a trailer park in Florida from a suburb in Michigan

He left the house headed for someplace downtown

Thinking who needs them, cuz they brought me down

Out on the streets words burning in his brain

With his pulse pumping just like a freight train,

Wondering what he has to lose

What's to lose anyhow

If he throws this rock will it all be solved now

Throw the brick one more time

Thinking of the problems that I left behind

Throw the brick


How many things that you believe

Are straight out of TV and magazines

And when comfort comes before thruth

Can you say that you never knew,

Sitting in front of your TV,

Do you believe the lies

Given to us from another time

And can you say that everything is fine

when your ideology is only right half the time

I'm growing up on the couch


Isn't it funny that it all comes down to money

Running on a treadmill, wasting time

Keeps you too busy to lose your mind

I was blindsided out on the street

The tension was so thick I could hardly even breathe

And I don't like the way things are going down

I don't like the way things are going down,

That's all, it's all

It's enough to knock me down

Man I was blindsided when a guy walked right past

Calls for help from this guy under the overpass

So I guess it's the "problem will go away if I block it out"

It's all enough to knock me down


Downbeat, downbeats coming for you

Everythings gone that you once knew.

Trying to rely on what things used to be

And trying to live up to your responsibility.

Everythings fucked up that you see.

Downbeats coming for you

And it's coming for me.

Trying to rely

Downbeats coming and you can't hide

Standing on the front porch

While downbeats collide,

And downbeats coming up up

It's got a grin

And I'm left in this situation.


>> rancid

i want to go where the action is

i want to fly through the urban blight

i want to live like a shadow in the dark

and only move at night

you're working like a monkey

who's been training by a sick junkie

on a mission to get money

for a new suit and tie 



to wear to a reception

where they envy your deception 

and give complements and praises to the ones they despite 



practicing your smile in the mirror all the while

try to cultivate the style of the bastards in power

i know what they're selling

cuz their nervous twitch is telling

you're coming off smelling like the pig of the hour





i got a lot of people telling me i'm outta my mind

and i don't know why 



my brain was bleeding and my fingers were proceding

through a notebook i was keeping since the dawning of time

senses were coroaded

you know that i was loaded

you were dealing i was reeling

from the feeling and the madness was consealing

it's a siren song

people that i trusted would surley have me busted

if they ever had a clue what was really going on 





i got a lot of people telling me i'm out of my mind

and i don't know why (i don't know why...let's go)


every city got an artery where the blood breaks down

an avenue or a boulevard and a boy who wears a crown

indigant live styles mplies simply lack of means

dogmatical authoritarians dictate the cities remains 



a promise

to go to heaven wont put salvation in sight 



Whirlwind is coming down on me 



when the factory shut down so did the place he lived

blood money for junk bonds by a white collar fugitive

all the tax free insentives ain't going to help him now

generations of job security gone out like the horse and plow 



a promise

to go to heaven won't put salvation in sight 



Whirlwind is coming down on me 



my old man worked his troubled life in a nowhere dead end

he drank the pain away i'll be damned if that's me having my dreams robbed

the working class carries a country that has been rotting inside for years

the rigs cuffed my old man in the front yard i saw through my eyes of tears

a promise to go to heaven wont put salvation in sight 



Whirlwind is coming down on me


i could not fit in

i was the one who got caught

i was the one who got realized

i was the one who got dropped

shut out banished and locked away

the knife that did me in i was carry to this day 



rejected

crossing the bridges in the land of the forgotten

rejected 



distrust existed that i never saw

deep seated trust i was a victim of 



rejected... 



unspoken among the more priveliged or the so called

i was not good enough not good enough at all

at first out of lonliness i tried to conform

but all that bullshit just left me alone


excuse me while i put i knife out of my back

how could i ever trust a person like that

along side the slow is someone moving faster

behind the warm image is a cold cold bastard 



corporate liberal bullshit ruling fucking class

take your fucking money and shove it up your ass

take your lies i've had enough of you

and all the shit that you put me through

i'm injured 



injury 



i look for the truth its getting hard to find

money grabbing dragon and the tie you hide behind

im so fucking stupid with you i was a buyer

i believed in you you deceiving liar

set me fucking free


>> falloutboy

I served out my detention

And in the end I got an honorable mention



In the movie of my life

Starring you

Instead of me



When the moonlight

Hits your bright eyes I go blind

And maybe next time

I'll remember not to tell you something stupid like I'll never leave your side



Like the oldest movie I ever saw was the one we wrote together

I said I hate you but I'd never change a thing

I can be your John Cusack



I burnt out

My defensive

Now everything I say is taken as offensive



In the movie of my life (movie of my life.. yeah)

Starring you

Instead of me



When the moonlight

Hits your bright eyes I go blind

And maybe next time

I'll remember not to tell you something stupid like I'll never leave your side



Like the oldest movie I ever saw was the one we wrote together

I said I hate you but I'd never change a thing

I can be your John Cusack



Oldest movie I ever saw was the one we wrote together

I said I hate you but I'd never change a thing

I can be your John Cusack

Be your John Cusack 

I can be your John Cusack


I sat outside my front window...this story's going somewhere:

"He's well hung," and I am hanging up.

Well there's a song on the radio that says:

"Let's get this party started."

So let's get this party started.



What you do on your own time's just fine.

My imagination's much worse, I just never want to know.

What meant the world imploded, faded and demoted

All my oxygen to product gas and suffocated my last chance



You said, between your smiles and regrets: "Don't say it's over."

Dead and gone. Dead and gone.

Calm before the storm set it off, and the sun burnt out tonight.

A reception less than warm set it off, and the sun burnt out tonight.



The next time the phone can wring my neck it gets no answer

and of the time that I've spent telling it my roots

I'm shaking in my boots

But still it looks at me like an old friend I've betrayed

the darkside of the doormat is the one your shoes have frayed



What you do on your own time's just fine. 

My imagination's much worse, I just never want to know.

What meant the world imploded, inflated then demoted 

All my oxygen to product gas and suffocated my last chance.



You said, between your smiles and regrets: "Don't say it's over."

Dead and gone. Dead and gone.

Calm before the storm set it off, and the sun burnt out tonight.

A reception less than warm set it off, and the sun burnt out tonight.


Walking out on the show is walking out on you

And walking out on you's still the best thing that I ever did.



Last night I saw my world explode, yeah

Last night I saw my world explode, yeah

Last night I saw my world explode, yeah

Last night I saw my world explode



Well, I'm looking out at you obscured by the stand up arcade

And the sound of the descendents.

Your smile reminds me of switchblades and infidelity.



Walking out on the show is walking out on you

And walking out on you's still the best thing that I ever did.



Last night I saw my world explode, yeah

Last night I saw my world explode, yeah

Last night I saw my world explode, yeah

Last night I saw my world explode



One, two, three, four

Last night I saw my world explode, yeah

Last night I saw my world explode, yeah

Last night I saw my world explode, yeah

Last night I saw my world explode


Walking off that stage tonight

I know what you're thinking 

"He stands alone because he's high on himself"

But if you only knew..



I was terrified and would you mind if I 

sat next to you and watched you smile

So many kids but I only see you

And I don't think you notice me

Well I've seen your boyfriend 

and I don't think he treats you right

But that's none of my business is it?



I'm not the way you think I am, no

I'm not the way you think I am, no



The only girl who ever gave me the time 

was the one who only wanted five minutes of mine

Knocking boots in the back,

How degrading is that?

I decline



I'm too terrified and would you mind if I 

sat next to you and watched you smile

So many kids but I only see you

And I don't think you notice me

Well I've seen your boyfriend 

and I don't think he treats you right

But that's none of my business is it?



I'm not the way you think I am, no

I'm not the way you think I am, no



I'm not the way you think I am, no

I'm not the way you think I am, no

I'm not the way you think I am, no

I'm not the way you think I am, no



I'm not the way you think I am, no

I'm not the way you think I am, no, no


I dried my eyes, now I crust them with sleep

I'll crust them over

She begged me "Don't hate me"

She spun me a story

Where winning looks like losing

And I'm winning every time

So thread spools, sweetie, get ready

Until my silk is sold



Growing up, whoa

Growing up, whoa

Growing up



Yeah

I'll find myself anew

Yeah

I'll find myself anew



I've dried my eyes, now it's "Rushmore"

I'm deep with futures like Chicago

No, Glenview never meant a thing to me

She never meant a thing to me

'Cept for putting idealists in a body bag

Forget it,

I'll go out tonight and piss on her doorstep

And listen to The Misfits "Where Eagles Dare" to swallow whole



Up, whoa

Growing up, whoa

Growing up



Go!



Whoa-oh-oh

I guess I'm my own better half

Whoa-oh-oh

I guess I'm my own better half

Whoa, yeah

I guess I'm on my own

Yeah, yeah

I guess I'm on my own

Yeah

I guess I'm on my own

Yeah, yeah, yeah

I guess I'm on my own


This might just be a waste of time

there's no one I'd rather waste

My time with than all my best friends

So start the car up



We'll all take turns not for the worst

We're all "hasbeens" and "never-were's"

And we're all in the back singing "Roxanne" 

Just watching life pass us by

Pass us by



As if we cared

Enough to try to catch up 

Enough to make up for lost time

Enough to make up for lost time, yeah



We've been down 

We've been out

We've been hanging 'round

Tip our glasses to no direction, yeah

Start the van

Get me out of this one horse town

Waste this night



We've been down 

We've been out

We've been hanging 'round

Tip our glasses to no direction, yeah

Start the van

Get me out of this one horse town 

Waste this night

Waste this night



We've been down 

We've been out

We've been hanging 'round

Tip our glasses to no direction, yeah

Start the van

Get me out of this one horse town 

Waste this night


She's shallow like the shoreline during low tide

But my hopes are not quite as high

Can't spot her faults but she spotted mine

She left me for herself

Considering I would too



Go figure, I'm bigger than that

Go figure, I'm bigger than that



The battles only halfway done

I might look young

But I'm no less defeated

How's the weather up there?



She left me for herself

Considering I would too



Good God I wish I was tall

Good God I wish 

Good God I wish I was tall

Good God I wish 

Good God I wish I was tall

Good God I wish 

Good God I wish I was tall

Good God I wish 



Go figure, I'm bigger than that

Go figure, I'm bigger than that

Go figure, I'm bigger than that

Go figure, I'm bigger than that


Last night I saw a movie

and I thought about many movies I've seen at your house

excuse me if I'm rude

but I'd rather that we just strike from the record ones I'd see again without you

leaning on my shoulder

distracting me from the plotline



Where can I go when I want you around

but I can't stand to be around you

"Go home"

I'll walk myself to you

I'll walk myself away from here



"Go to hell" is all I thought for seven weeks

but I grew out of that phase looking at these broken photographs of people

looking glossed just like the way I still remember a summer ago



Where can I go when I want you around

but I can't stand to be around you

"Go home"

I'll walk myself to you

I'll walk myself away from here



"Call me back" 

I'm pleading with a bottle cork in my head

It wouldn't be the first time

my pillow has been mistaken



Where can I go when I want you around

but I can't stand to be around you

"Go home"

I'll walk myself to you

I'll walk myself away from here



Can't stand to be around you

Around you, around you

Can't stand to be around you

I can't stand, can't stand

To be around you

Around you

Around you

Around you...


You laughed off my affections

While I passed by your direction

I should have known from your walk, yeah

It was the end of you



It's not like I don't respect your opinion

Your quick wit lips, just rip me apart

Sometimes, it's times like this, yeah



I got a big mouth

And maybe you could handle shutting it up

A simple contradiction

Could shake my whole foundation

Parker Lewis can't lose



Taking back every step towards you

Still failing at everything I do

In the meantime just talking with my shoes

Converse with my Converse

At least they hear a word I say

And scrutinize it

Just as far as they can tell what I'm getting at

Tied my tongue around my neck

For the last time



It's not like I don't respect your opinion

Your quick wit lips, just tear me apart

Sometimes, it's times like this, yeah 



I got a big mouth

And maybe you could handle shutting it up

A simple contradiction

Could shake my whole foundation

Parker Lewis can't lose, yeah

Yeah

Yeah



This is the last song about you

This is the last song that I waste on you


Light that smoke, that one for giving up on me

And one just cause they’ll kill you sooner than my expectations

To my favorite liar, to my favorite scar (to my favorite scar):

“I could have died with you”

I hope you choke on those words, that kiss, that bottle- I confess

Now ask yourself, yeah, out on the insides, I said I loved you but I lied



Let’s play this game called “when you catch fire”

I wouldn’t piss to put you out

Stop burning bridges and drive off of them

So I can forget about you



So bury me in memory

His smile’s your rope

So wrap it tight around your throat



On the drive home

Joke about the kid you used to see

And his jealousy

Breaking hearts has never looked so cool

As when you wrap your car around a tree

Your makeup looks so great next to his teeth



Let’s play this game called “when you catch fire”

I wouldn’t piss to put you out

Stop burning bridges and drive off of them

So I can forget about you



So bury me in memory

His smile’s your rope

So wrap it tight around your throat





So bury me in memory around your throat


>> placebo

Stuck between the do or die, I feel emaciated.

Hard to breathe I try and try, I'll get asphyxiated.

Swinging from the tallest height, with nothing left to hold on to.



Every sky is blue, but not for me and you.



Come home, come home, come home, come home.



Glass and petrol vodka gin, it feels like breathing methane.

Throw yourself from skin to skin, and still it doesn't dull the pain.

Vanish like a lipstick trace, it always blows me away.



Every cloud is grey, with dreams of yesterday.



Come home, come home, come home, come home,

come home, come home, come home, come home.



Always goes against the grain, and I can try and deny it

Give a monkey half a brain, and still he's bound to fry it.

Now the happening scene is dead, I used to want to be there too.



Every sky is blue, but not for me and you.



Come home, come home, come home, come home,

come home, come home, come home, come home.


Shine the headlight, straight into my eyes.

Like the roadkill, I'm paralysed.

You see through my disguise



At the drive-in, double feature,

pull the lever, break the fever

and say your last goodbyes.



Since I was born I started to decay.

Now nothing ever ever goes my way



One fluid gesture, like stepping back in time.

Trapped in amber, petrified.

And still not satisfied



Airs and social graces, elocution so divine.

I'll stick to my needle, and my favourite waste of time,

both spineless and sublime.



Since I was born I started to decay.

Now nothing ever - ever goes my way.


Harder faster, forever after,

harder faster, forever after,

harder faster, forever after,

forever after.



None of you can make the grade,

none of you can make the grade,

none of you can make the grade,

none of you can make the grade.



Harder faster, forever after,

harder faster, forever after,

harder faster, forever after,

forever after.



None of you can make the grade,

none of you can make the grade,

none of you can make the grade,

none of you can make the grade.


We were tight, but it falls apart as silver turns to blue.

Waxing with a candlelight, and burning just for you.

Allocate your sentiment, and stick it in a box.

I've never been an extrovert, but i'm still breathing.



Someone tried to do me ache (it's what I'm afraid of)



With hindsight, I was more than blind, lost without a clue.

Thought I was getting carat gold, and what I got was you.

Stuck inside the circumstances, lonely at the top.

I've always been an introvert

happily bleeding.



Someone tried to do me ache (it's what i'm afraid of)



4 7 2 3 9 8 5 - I gotta breathe to stay alive,

and 1 4 2 9 7 8 - feels like I'm gonna suffocate.

14 16 22 - this skin that turns to blister blue.

Shoulders toes and knees, I'm 36 degrees,

shoulders toes and knees,I'm 36 degrees,

shoulder toes and knees, I'm 36 degrees,

shoulders toes and knees, I'm 36 degrees.


Chinese masseuse, comes between us

talks in haikus, plastic venus.

Got a headrush, in her pocket

two rubbers two lubes, and a silver rocket



Hang on, hang on

to your IQ, to your ID

hang on, hang on

to your IQ, to your ID



I'm lonely



Every morning, my eyes will open wide

I gotta get high, before I go outside.

Roll another, for breakfast

burning clouds around, and in my solar plexus.



Hang on, hang on

to your IQ, to your ID

hang on, hang on

to your IQ, to your ID



I'm lonely



Legs eleven, makes me stay up late

two fat ladies on my back, and now it's 88.

I'm a fool, whose tool is small

it's so miniscule, it's no tool at all.



hang on, hang on

to your IQ, to your ID

hang on, hang on

I'm lonely



Oh.


Alcoholic kind of mood

lose my clothes, lose my lube

cruising for a piece of fun

looking out for number one

different partner every night

so narcotic outta sight

what a gas, what a beautiful ass.



And it all breaks down at the role reversal,

got the muse in my head she's universal,

spinnin' me round she's coming over me.

And it all breaks down at the first rehearsal,

got the muse in my head she's universal,

spinnin' me round she's coming over me.



Kind of buzz that lasts for days

had some help from insect ways

comes across all shy and coy

just another nancy boy.

Woman man or modern monkey

just another happy junkie

fifty pounds, press my button

going down.



And it all breaks down at the role reversal

got the muse in my head she's universal,

spinnin' me round she's coming over me.

And it all breaks down at the first rehearsal,

got the muse in my head she's universal,

spinnin' me round she's coming over me.



Does his makeup in his room

douse himself with cheap perfume

eyeholes in a paper bag

greatest lay I ever had

kind of guy who mates for life

gotta help him find a wife

we're a couple, when our bodies double.



And it all breaks down at the role reversal

got the muse in my head she's universal,

spinnin' me round she's coming over me.

And it all breaks down at the first rehearsal,

got the muse in my head she's universal,

spinnin' me round she's coming over me.

I know, you love the song but not the singer

I know, you've got me wrapped around your finger

I know, you want the sin without the sinner

I know

I know



I know, the past will catch you up as you run faster

I know, the last in line is always called a bastard

I know, the past will catch you up as you run faster

I know

I know



I know, you cut me loose in contradiction

I know, I'm all wrapped up in sweet attrition

I know, it's asking for your benediction

I know

I know



I know, the past will catch you up as you run faster

I know, the last in line is always called a bastard

I know, the past will catch you up as you run faster

The means are right for taking, fade to grey

Trying to be ruthless, in the face of beauty

In this matrix, it's plain to see

It's either you or me.



Bruise,

pristine,

serene,

we were born to lose.



Cast a line with a velvet glove

Reading like an open book, in the hands of love

In this matrix, it's plain to see

It's either you or me.



Bruise,

we were born to lose.

'Scuse me, I apologize

he likes your attitude, he tries it on for size

he spends the afternoon, between your thighs

how's that for gratitude, I apologize.



It seemed to last for hours

It seemed to last for days

This lady of the flowers

and her hypnotic gaze.



'Scuse me, I apologize

she's got vacum cleaner eyes

suck you in

she's got magazines, filled with pear pies

'scuse me, I apologize



It seemed to last for hours

It seemed to last for days

This lady of the flowers

and her hypnotic gaze.



She wears her tears on her blouse

confused and racked with self-doubt

she stole the keys to my house

and then she locked herself out.



'Scuse me, I apologize

he likes your attitude, he tries it on for size

he spends the afternoon, between your thighs

how's that for gratitude, I apologize.



It seemed to last for hours

It seemed to last for days

This lady of the flowers

her electronic haze.



She wears her tears on her blouse

confused and racked with self-doubt

she stole the keys to my house

and then she locked herself out.



She stole the keys to my house

and then she locked herself out.



She lays me down

she lays me.

(1,2,3,4!)

Well, she was just 17
You know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another (Ooh)
When I saw her standing there

Well she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Whooh)
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine...

Whoah, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another (Whooh)
Since I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine...

Whoah, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another (Whooh)
Since I saw her standing there


The world is treating me bad... Misery

I'm the kind of guy
Who never used to cry
The world is treating me bad... Misery!

I've lost her now for sure
I won't see her no more
It's gonna be a drag... Misery!

I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one

Send her back to me
Cos everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery

I'll remember all the little things we've done
She'll remember and she'll miss her only one, lonely one

Send her back to me
Cos everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery (Oh oh oh)
In misery (Ooh ee ooh ooh)
My misery (La la la la la la)


Anna
You come and ask me, girl
To set you free, girl
You say he loves you more than me
So I will set you free
Go with him
Go with him

Anna
Girl, before you go now
I want you to know, now
That I still love you so
But if he loves you more
Go with him

All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
Oh, now, but every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves my sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do

Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free
Go with him

Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free
Go with him

And they ain't the kind that you can see

I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I, I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue

Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry
And in time, you'll understand the reason why
If I cry, it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had

I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery

Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I, I, I, I

And I'm always thinking of you

I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery

I lay on the beach lost in the blue of the shoreline
I baked in the sun I did it for you the sky was mine
The seabreezes were blowing like the Winds of Fame
I swear I heard them talking calling out your name

Do you recall when we first met it was snowing
In that smothered town with the doors all shut and windows glowing
On the corner buttons tugging we were standing stamping our feet
We just ahead of the others we were just behind the beat

And I was saying to you
Are you stepping out with me tonight its us against the world
I won't Bogart the bottle if you don't Cagney the girls

Promise not to tell
Promise not to tell

We stood at the fire that burned in the mirror of the bottle
We drank down the dregs of wonder and terror and opened the throttle

We stole joy building stories from the stuff of pain
We earned grace burnt it in the chase and through it all remained

Promise not to tell
Promise not to tell
Promise not to tell
Promise not to tell
Whoo
Promise not to tell
Promise not to tell
Promise not to tell


If I had the sun and the moon
and all the stars of the brightest night
I'd make your every hour high noon
yes I would
you never did like the light

I know that you've been lying
I know that you've been lying
I know that you've been lying to me

Everyone should know their place
but I find it so hard to leave
You wear your face behind your face
and you know me baby
I wear my heart on my sleeve

I know that you've been lying
I know that you've been lying
I know - yes I know - that you've been lying to me

That's the lowdown - yeah

Friends have all come round and they're drinking
I'm inside the sound of glasses clinking
The worst are all inspired
The best they're all tongue-tied
They see too many sides oh babe
I want you back again

I sit very still but I'm rushing
To the place where once we were touching
Baby don't you realise that
The others don't hypnotise me
They just don't mesmerise me babe
I want you back
I want you back again

I sit very still but I'm rushing
To the place where once we were touching

On slippery ice he's skating
but he don't have a care
Beneath his feet its breaking
but his head's in the air
Everyone's anticipating
he's gonna take a dive
Turn down your conversations
here comes the fall guy

Here comes that fall guy
Here comes that fall guy

I know I shouldn't ought to
reach for illusion
Just like a lamb to the slaughter
I only see confusion
Everyone's in expectation
this head is gonna roll
Turn down your conversations
here comes the fall guy

You can't help bad luck oh no
You can't help bad luck oh no
You can't help bad luck oh no
But it's a fool who puts his head in a frame

On slippery ice he's skating
but he don't have a care
Beneath his feet its breaking
but his head's in the air
Everyone's anticipating
he's gonna take a dive
Turn down your conversations
here comes the fall guy

You can't help bad luck oh no
You can't help bad luck oh no
You can't help bad luck oh no
Here comes that fall guy

I'm not
always trying to keep me down
keep me crawling on the ground
I can't win
I never seem to graduate
always end up on first base

But it won't fade away
But it won't fade away
you're gonna hear from me

When I'm
standing on my own two feet
always seem to draw the heat
I'm not always taken for a fool
someone else is making the rules

But it won't fade away
But it won't fade away
They're gonna hear from me

I'll admit I feel shaky
but it won't be me
I know they love to see me breaking
but it won't be me

I'm not
guaranteed to make you tough
can't you see I've had enough
I can't win
I never seem to graduate
always end up on first base

But it won't fade away
But it won't fade away
But it won't fade away
But it won't fade away

And they won't break me down
And they won't break me down



I want to be like Billy Baxter
and lose my limitations
I want to be like Billy Baxter
and do imitations

Billy's got a thousand faces
he's a lover and a gambler too
Just to see him go through his paces
is a lesson for all the crew

'Coz he got a hungry heart
He got love to burn
'Coz he got a hungry heart
He got love to burn

Billy's in love with abandon
but he never seems to lose control
He can walk right through disaster
everyone in pieces but he's still whole

I want to be like Billy Baxter
and lose my limitations
I want to be like Billy Baxter
and do imitations

'Coz he got a hungry heart
He got love to burn
'Coz he got a hungry heart
He got love to burn

Hold it steady Billy
while I pour the wine
When you think you're ready Billy
play that pantomime for me one time

I want to be like Billy Baxter
I want to be like Billy Baxter
I want to be like Billy Baxter
I want to be like Billy Baxter


I took a woman late last night
guess I ended up with two
One was the woman lying by my side
the other one was you

Recognition
In the strangest places
Recognition
Mixing up these faces

I've been hearing rumours on the phone
say you're coming back to me
I've been seeing movies all alone
They all star you and me

Recognition
In the strangest places
Recognition
Mixing up these faces

Sister Anne Maria with the English lips
they always bring it down on me
Sister Anne Maria with the Spanish hips
they always bring it down on me

Recognition
In the strangest places
Recognition
Mixing up these faces

Recognition
In the strangest places
Recognition
Mixing up these faces


Cherry
In the middle of the back seat
as we're cruising on down the street
to set the night on fire

Cherry
She gives him some of her precious time
but she knows just where to draw the line
She's a mistress of desire

Slow night
Slow night
Slow night on fire

He is young
but old enough to know better
She says it doesn't matter
as she takes him high

The dream gets bad
begins to split at the seams
Oh - he spills her beans
they start to spread like fire

Slow night
Slow night
Slow night on fire

Cherry
you know there ain't no second tries
yeah you gotta have a thousand eyes
to keep from going under

Cherry
everybody wants to deal with you
everybody comes to kneel to you
they're trying to steal your thunder

Slow night
Slow night
Slow night on fire


The way love used to run to me
and we carved a heart upon the tree
The way love used to make a stand
they used to laugh, they didn't understand
My eyes deceived me, love wasn't real

Now you come on along
Now you come on along

The way love used to run me round
I was here and there, I could not be found
The way love used to kiss my lip
but my hold on love would always slip
My eyes deceived me, love wasn't real

Now you come on along
Now you come on along

The way love used to sing to me
I thought my ears had starved that melody
The way love used to count to ten
Am I to believe tis gonna happen again?
Am I deceived, can this be real?

Now you come on along
Now you come on along


I hate to watch you loving him
I hate to watch you loving him
I hate to watch him loving you
Like some jumped up dream
Anyone can see that you're loving every minute
you would not be in it for the world

I hate to watch him touching you
I hate to watch him clutching you
I hate to watch him crutching you
All across the floor
Anyone can see that you're loving every minute
you would not be in it for the world

You would not be in it for the world
You would not be in it for the world
You would not be in it for the world
You would not be in it for the world
You would not be in it for the world
You would not be in it for the world

You would not be in it for the world
You would not be in it for the world
You would not be in it for the world
You would not be in it for the world
You would not be in it for the world
You would not be in it for the world

I hate to watch you loving him
I hate to watch you loving him

Someone looking out for me
You can step right up and show yourself if you will
It seems like I've been hiding from my friends too long
You can take over for a while- I need the rest
A chance to laugh it off
I ain't made sense in so long - I almost quit trying

This can't be the way it's supposed to work
I've tried by myself and now I want to try it out with you
You may not believe I need it - I haven't shown it in the past
It took me a while to get above myself
I barely made the test
You're out there and I feel you
So come on out of hiding

Someone looking out for me
You can step right up and show yourself if you will
It seems like I've been hiding from my friends too long
You can take over for a while - I need the rest
A chance to laugh it off
I ain't made sense in so long - I almost quit trying


Ripped off and run out of town
Had my guitar burned when I was clownin'
Haven't slept in a bed for a week
And my shoes feel like they're part of my feet
Let me come down where I won't be a bother to no one
Let me unwind please give me a hole to recline in

Knocked on my friend's door in moody texas
And asked if he had a place for me
His hair was cut off and he was wearing a suit
And he said not in my house, not in my house
You look like you're part of a conspiracy

Now I'm six hours out on strawberry flats
Trying to get to Waco 'fore it freezes over
They're stopping every one who looks too weird
At the ghoul bust texas road block
Oh let me come down where I won't be a bother to no one
Let me unwind please give me a hole to recline in

Got a ride on a highway king
Made the cross road by nine fifteen
If I don't find a place to crash
Well I might as well cash it all in

If I was a no 'count gambler or a Texas fool
Or a millionaire with a suit and real short hair
Or do you even care


His tail-lights flickered as he pulled up to the truck stop
The same old crowd was hanging out again tonite
He said fill up my tank while I go check my load
It feels like it's shifting all around

He was the kind of man
Do all he could
Above all he had integrity
But he was so young
And on a ten city run
In love with a truck stop girl

As he went inside hew was merrily greeted
By the girl with who he was in love
She held out a glass and said have another
This is the last time we can meet
With her hair piled up high and a look in her eye
That would turn any good man's blood to wine
All his eyes could see, all his eyes could see
Was the stares from all those around him

He ran out to the lot and climbed into his rig
And drove off without tightening down
It was a terrible thing
To see what remained of the rig that poor danny was in
But he was so young
On a ten city run
In love with a truck stop girl

But he was so young
On a ten city run
In love with a truck stop girl


Matthew stood by the wall and watched his love below
Her pale hair came in golden rings down below her shoulders
As she waved and slowly turned around
To find the path that led her to the ancient gate was closed

She said Matthew why won't you tell me what it is you see
Your smile so wide this figured grin
You look as if, you look as if you're looking right through me
Why won't you tell me how it is you see
Through the darkness all around me

No amulets or chains will work to keep the demons from
Or hide the night filled eyes from the brides of Jesus
The brides of Jesus
The brides of Jesus
Keep them over me
Keep them over me, can't you see
On tender-hooks and to be pleasure bent
His voice it scratched the air
May bring you so much sorrow
That you may be entertaining angels unawares


I been warped by the rain
Driven by the snow
I'm drunk and dirty, don't ya know
And I'm still, oh, I'm still
I'm out on the road late at night
I see my pretty Alice in every headlight
Alice, Dallas Alice

I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari
Tehachapi to Tonapah
Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
Now I've driven the back roads
So I wouldn't get weighed
And if you give me weed, whites, and wine
Then you show me a sign
I'll be willin' to be movin'

Now I smuggled some smokes
And folks from Mexico
Baked by the sun
Almost every time I go to Mexico
And I'm willin'

And I've been kicked by the wind
Robbed by the sleet
Had my head stoved in
But I'm still on my feet
And I'm willin', oh, I'm willin'

And I been from Tuscon to Tucumcari
Tehachapi to Tonapah
Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
Driven the back roads
So I wouldn't get weighed
And if you give me weed, whites, and wine
And then you show me a sign
I'll be willin' to be movin'


Square knees was asking for a reason
How can I go sleeping in a car
I got red hot tires my tires are smokin'
I'm so broke I don't wanna stop
My gears are crying
My gears are crying
I got the ha hamburger
Ha hamburger
I got the ha hamburger midnight blues
Got a grease mother she's a holder finder
Keeper of the scooter gas
You gotta lift your tail and seal you fate
Snort the crank your old man stashed
And ride a tin can
Ride a tin can street machine

Square knees was asking for a reason
How can I go sleeping in a car
I got red hot tires my tires are smokin'
I'm so broke I don't wanna stop
My gears are crying
My gears are crying
I got the ha hamburger
I got the ha hamburger
I got the ha hamburger midnight blues


I wore my.44 so long, Lord it made my shoulder sore
I wore my.44 so long, Lord it made my shoulder sore
I'm going to a party, where they say my baby's gone

I bin so bad this mornin', I don't know what I'm gonna do
Well, I woke up so mad this mornin', I just don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm going to my baby's house, I'm gonna tell her where I'm goin'

How many more years, are you gonna dog me around
How many more years, are you gonna dog me around
You took all my money, all my love too

Well I went down to my baby's house
And I asked her for my clothes
Well I went down to my baby's house
And I asked her for my clothes
Ah hoo


I don't even know what I did wrong
But her old man said if I didn't get out of town
I might not live too long
And I can still see her mother with her hair up in rolls
As she cast a telling glance at that young girl's red hot eyes
Sometimes I think I could lose
All my troubles but here I stand
They're trying to cure me with nicotine and whiskey
Watching their faces passing me by

And I've been holding out my hand
Waiting for love to come at my command
But the glow from around my head is gone
And if I don't get a ride real soon
I might be dead in the ground

Sometimes I think I could lose
All my troubles but here I stand
They're trying to cure me with nicotine and whiskey
Watching their faces passing me by

There's no need to follow
Look into the eyes of this wandering stranger
I won't rob or steal your money
So don't let the wind through the crack in your door
Don't let the wind through the crack in your door


I've been the one who has been frightened
And almost borne away
By the very thoughts that I feared yesterday
And it must be dust or smoke that's in my eyes
How can I cry about something from someone that I won't see

Oh my friends all say she had her chance
Let's go shoot some pool
You know a fool is just a fool
And I've tried everything that whiskey cures
But the pain endures
And now I'm feeling that pain
I put my pride in my pocket
That's how I'll spend my loneliest days
And it must be dust or smoke that's in my eyes

Don't know what to do
Hold the lamp above the rafters
These smoke-filled rooms will not replace her

I've been the one who has been frightened
And almost borne away
By the very thoughts that I feared yesterday
And it must be dust or smoke that's in my eyes


I'm just takin' my time so please don't rush me
I gotta sort out some things I didn't know existed
I've been here before I know where the traps lie
I can only take what's there 'cause the rest doesn't matter

I'm tired of talk so please don't rush me
You know I want the same things that you do
You're wastin' your time the way you come on to me
Slow down your rhymes and try to reason

You can't make things move any faster
By second-wishing them to death
You seem to be living on a level that's decent enough
You got what you wanted so why do you tell me
I'm on the wrong track
I'm doing the best I can do

Why try to out-guess a situation
That I know you're not even fully aware of
I want you to know that if it keeps on this way
I can't keep on letting you bring me down

Let it hang out baby, let it hang out now, now na-na now
Let it hang out baby, everybody work out
Sookie, Sookie, Sookie, Sookie, Sookie, Sookie, Sue

Let it hang out baby, do the Baltimore jig
Let it hang out baby, boomerang with me
Sookie, Sookie, Sookie, Sookie, Sookie, Sookie, Sue

Really got it bad child, drink a bottle of turpentine
When you wake up in the morning, feelin' kinda fine
Let it hang out baby, let it hang out now, now na-na now

You better watch your step girl, don't step on that banana peel
If your foot should ever hit it, you'll go up to the ceiling
Hang it in baby, hang it in baby
Sookie, Sookie, Sookie, Sookie, Sookie, Sookie, Sue

Let it hang out baby, let it hang out now, now na-na now
Let it hang out baby, everybody work out
Hang it in baby, hang it in baby, hang it in baby

She's all alone, just lost another one
Met him yesterday and he's already gone
And though tonight she'll swear it was the last time
A smiling face will come that knows the right line
And then she'll do all the right things with the wrong guy
And when he's gone, next day she'll sit and wonder why

She doesn't know why she's everybody's next one
'Cause she's afraid that the truth is gonna hurt some
All the pity in the world ain't gonna help none
She has to realize that to keep one, her ways have to change some

She tries too hard and she comes on too strong
Digs herself too much and thinks she can't be wrong
She's too impressed by things that do not matter
To be the Queen of hearts is what she's after.
And then she'll do all the right things with the wrong guy
And when he's gone, next day she'll sit and wonder why

She doesn't know why she's everybody's next one
'Cause she's afraid that the truth is gonna hurt some
All the pity in the world ain't gonna help none
She has to realize that to keep one, her ways have to change some

Repeat


Well thinkin' of my school days, I remember Maybeline
Used to dance with her all night she was little sweet sixteen
Her brother used to chase me
He thought I did, but I never could
I used to call him Little Queenie
His name was Johnnie B. Good

I used to hold her 'til I was older
Then I got bolder,
Her brother used to scold her
I left there in the mornin'
Went back to Memphis, Tennessee
You know her brother never found me
And that's all right with me

I went to New York City to find what could be found
Just for kicks down sixty six, stopped in L.A. Town
Yes I went to California just to see what I could see
Well nobody knew just where I was
And that's alright with me
You know I met a girl named Carol
And her girlfriend sweet Nadine,
Played the rock n' roll music
Used to kiss me in between
Roll over Beethoven that happened to be her favorite song
But we never did much rollin'
I didn't stay there long

I used to hold her and try to mold her
Somebody told her, Nadine and I were bolder
I left there in the mornin'
Went back to Memphis, Tenneessee
You know, I never saw her face again
And that's alright with me

Repeat


The gypsy woman told my mama
On the day I was born
Oh, you got a boy child comin'
Oh Lord, he's gonna be a sun of a gun
He's gonna make those pretty women
You know, he's gonna make 'em jump and shout
The whole wide world gonna wonder
What it's all about

Yeah, you know I'm here
And everybody knows I'm here
I'm your Hoochie Coochie man
Oh Lord, Everybody knows I'm here

I got a black cat bone
Lord I got a mojo too
I got little John, the conquered
Oh baby, I'm gonna mess with you
I'm gonna grab those pretty women
I'm gonna grab 'em by the hand
You know, the whole wide world gonna know
Oh Lord, I'm your Hoochie Coochie man
Yes, you know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here

On the seventh hour
Oh Lord, on the seventh day
I tell you on the seventh month, child
Hey, the seven doctors say
Now he was born for luck
I said, baby, don't you see
I got seven hundred dollars darlin'
Don't you mess with me

Because I'm here
Everybody, everybody knows I'm here
I'm you Hoochie Coochie man
Hey, I tell you, everybody knows I'm here


Get your motor runnin'
Head out on the highway
Lookin' for adventure
And whatever comes our way
Yeah Darlin' go make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space

I like smoke and lightning
Heavy metal thunder
Racin' with the wind
And the feelin' that I'm under
Yeah Darlin' go make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space

Like a true nature's child
We were born, born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die

Born to be wild
Born to be wild


Your wall's too high, I can't see
Can't seem to reach you, can't set you free
If you can hear me, follow the sound
And help me tear your wall down to the ground

Everyone gets hurt sometimes
Everybody plays the game
If you don't win the first time
Come back and try again
Rocks and bricks can't help you
You can't hide behind your wall
Why don't you try to jump it little girl
I'll catch you if you fall

Ah, sometimes early in the mornin'
Without warnin' you'll realize
That you ain't too wise
With your head bowed down you go downtown
Watch an old lady hit the ground
Lots of people standin' round
But nobody seems to know her

You're an hour late when you reach your floor
Ah, and everybody tells you
That your boss is sore
Watch the clock for seven more
Then go flyin' through the door
Back home again the day is gone
You're safe and sound but still alone
And when the night falls around your walls
Ah, tell me don't you ever wish to go outside
Follow the lights and go outside
You'll be alright, just go outside


When rain drops fall and you feel low
Ah, do you ever think it's useless
Do you feel like letting go
Do you ever sit and do you wonder
Will the world ever change
And just how long will it take
To have it all rearranged

Tell me why these things are still the same
Tell me why no one can seem to learn from mistakes

Take my hand if you don't know where your goin'
I'll understand, I've lost the way myself
Oh, don't take that old road it leads to nowhere
We must return before the clock strikes twelve

It's so easy to do nothin'
When you're busy night and day
Take a step in one direction
And take a step the other way
So don't stop tryin' when you stumble
Don't give up should you fall
Keep on searchin' for the passway
That will lead you through the wall
Don't look back or you'll be left behind
Don't look back or you will never find peace of mind


You know I've smoked a lot of grass
O' Lord, I've popped a lot of pills
But I never touched nothin'
That my spirit could kill
You know, I've seen a lot of people walkin' 'round
With tombstones in their eyes
But the pusher don't care
Ah, if you live or if you die

God damn, The Pusher
God damn, I say The Pusher
I said God damn, God damn The Pusher man

You know the dealer, the dealer is a man
With the love grass in his hand
Oh but the pusher is a monster
Good God, he's not a natural man
The dealer for a nickel
Lord, will sell you lots of sweet dreams
Ah, but the pusher ruin your body
Lord, he'll leave your, he'll leave your mind to scream

God damn, The Pusher
God damn, God damn the Pusher
I said God damn, God, God damn The Pusher man

Well, now if I were the president of this land
You know, I'd declare total war on The Pusher man
I'd cut him if he stands, and I'd shoot him if he'd run
Yes I'd kill him with my Bible and my razor and my gun

God damn The Pusher
Gad damn The Pusher
I said God damn, God damn The Pusher man


She used to dance when she had the chance and the time it didn't
matter
At the end of her night was an endless flight
While her head, it was lost in the laughter

A girl I knew
Someone I used to talk to
When we'd meet in the middle of a room
A girl I knew
Her world a shade of blue
Someone I used to talk to

She used to sing in the night while her ring
It would sparkle like burgundy wine
And the people stopped and starred but pretend she's not there

She used to dance when she had the chance and the time it didn't
matter
At the end of her night was an endless flight
While her head, it was lost in the laughter


Take my hand sweet darlin'
Wipe that frown off your face
I don't love anyone but you
No one can take your place
But sometimes I worry darlin'
The way you seem to hog my love

Just take what you need
Don't empty out the store
Just take what you need
'Cause I ain't got much more

Took a stroll in the country
Some peace of mind to find
Wire fences everywhere
No place to rest my mind
Seems like a shame to me
The way some people hog the land

Repeat Chorus

Took a look in the paper
While tryin' to eat a bite
You know I read the evenin' news
And lost my appetite
Some have the nerve to ask
For more respect from you and me

Repeat Chorus


>> jeffersonstarship

Hide witch hide the good folks come to burn thee
Their keen enjoyment hid behind a gothic mask of duty

Put your old ladies back into bed
Put your old men into their graves
Cover their ears so they can't hear us sing
Cover their eyes so they can't see us play
Get out of the way
Let the people play
We're gonna get down on you
Come alive all over you
Dancin' down into your town

You know Tyrannosaurus Rex was destroyed before
By a furry little ball that crawled along
The primeval jungle floor
He stole the eggs of the dinosaur
CLOSE YOUR EYES & CREATE THE SOUND
OPEN YOUR HANDS & REBUILD THE GROUND
We are egg snatchers -
flashin' sunshine children
Bunch of diamond thieves

You unleash the dogs
of a grade-B movie star governor's war
While you sit in the dark -
insane with the fear of dying
We'll ball in your parks
- insane with the flash of living

I'M ALIVE
I AM HUMAN
I WILL BE ALIVE AGAIN
So drop your fuckin' bombs
Burn your demon babies
I WILL BE AGAIN -
Rabid lover-feelin' the starch in your grin
Callin' for acid cocaine and grass
And receiving your homemade gin
PUSH THE BUTTON
PULL THE SWITCH
CUT THE BEAM
C'MON MAKE IT MARCH
Sign me up as a diplomat - my only office is the park

You need to be out before you come in
After you come you go
In the midst of Yang is a smaller part of Yin
And when it happens you know -
THE DAWN COMES

HEY DICK
Whatever you think of us is totally irrelevant
Both to us now and to you
We are the present
We are the future
You are the past
Pay your dues and get outta the way
'Cause we're not the way you used to be
When you were very young
We're something new
We don't quite know what it is
Or particularly care
We just do it - You gotta do it
Let the music do it, take you there
Do it, do it, do it - gotta do it
Something new, something new, something new
New, New

Open your eyes there's a new world a-comin'
Open your eyes there's a new world today
Open your hearts people are lovin'
Open it all we've come to stay
I said, Open it all we've come to stay
I said, Open it all we've come to stay
People, hey you people, everybody
Us young people come to stay
I said, people, on relief
We've all come to stay
Open your eyes there's a new world a-comin'
Open it all we've come to stay
Yeah, yeah, yeah, open it all
Open it, open it, baby,
NOW OPEN THAT DOOR


There's an island way out in the sea
Where the babies they all grow on trees
And its jolly good fun To swing in the sun
But you gotta watch out if you sneeze-sneeze
You gotta watch out if you sneeze

Yeah you gotta watch out if you sneeze
For swingin' up there in the breeze
You're liable to cough
You might very well fall off
And tumble down flop on your knees-knees
Tumble down flop on your knees

And when the stormy winds wail
And the breezes blow high in a gale
There's a curious dropping and flopping and plopping
And fat little babies just hail-hail
Fat little babies just hail

And the babies lie there in a pile
And the adults they come after awhile
And they always pass by
All the babies that cry
And take only babies that smile-smile
They take only babies that smile...
Even triplets and twins if they'll smile


Wherever I go I see you people
I see you people just like me
And whatever you do I want to do
And the Pooh and you and me together make three

Let's Go Together
Let's Go Together
Let's Go Together

Wave goodbye to America
Say hello to the garden
You know I see - I see the way you feel
And I know that your life is real
Pioneer searcher refugee
I follow you and you follow me

Let's Go Together
Let's Go Together
Let's Go Together

Wave goodbye to America
Say hello to the garden


Last electric Sunday mornin' waitin' in the park for the dawn
Listenin' to all the animals in the Park and in the city beyond
Flashin' with my lady. sky goin' black to blue
She said I got a surprise for you

A child is coming
A child is coming
A child is coming to you

What are we gonna do when Uncle Samuel comes around
Askin' for the young one's name
And lookin' for the print of his hand for the files in their numbers game
I don't want his chances for freedom to ever be that slim
Let's not tell 'em about him -

A child is coming
A child is coming
A child is coming to you, it's comin'

 To create
 It's gettin' better
 To learn

 And all of us together

I wanna see his head rising
I wanna see his head rise to mine


Sunrise
Surprise
Civilized Man
You were keeper to me
Now your animal is free
And you're free to die
Die
You're old and your hands are gray
Your old go home and
We've all heard you dirty stories
Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Of your
God damn
Glory


The summer was dry like your nose when you've been behind coke for a day and a season
We sail out into the grasshopper nite and we seek the righteous poison
Sunday morning in speedway, y'know the people come around for a reason
SUNDAY MORNIN SUNDAY MORNIN
The land is green and you make it grow, go to the forest and move
The sound of thundering electrical energy calls us to the park in the noon
C'mon anybody-now fill my pipe (to the park) to the forest and move

When I feel you coming round me - ridin in the sun
Goin home move your mind toward Mars and then beyond
Genesis is not the answer to what we had before
I we altogether in you

You know I remember the 23rd of November
To the abyss of Chicago you can see the barbed wire - pigs around a lot of nothin
The witch hunters wail and they bark and they wheeze and they try to turn us onto their poison

You know - a starship circlin in the sky - it ought to be ready by 1990
They'll be buildin it up in the air even since 1980
People with a clever plan can assume the role of the mighty
and HIJACK THE STARSHIP
Carry 7000 people past the sun
And our babes'll wander naked thru the cities of the universe
Cmon free minds, free bodies, free dope, free music
the day is on its way the day is ours

You breathe out You breathe in
And the glow of the machine'll get you on
Moving slow, don't feel the changes
Gracefully growing - as wild as we can be

Only the sun knows what we really need to know
Only the sun holds the secret
And more than human can we be
Cause human's truly locked
To this planetary circle

You gotta ride said the Doktor of space
I have lived here once before
The lites in the nite are a village of stars
Of stars that I have explored
Beyond the idea of beyond the void
And beyond that and more
Parallel lines in this village of stars
Will lead you to the second door
And time won't wait for the Doktor of space from the city of the sun to come

WHERE DO YOU GO FROM HERE
CHAOS OR COMMUNITY
CAN'T YOU SEE - ON THIS AND FUTURE SUNDAYS

7000 Gypsies swirlin together
Offering to the sun in the name of the weather
Gonna Hijack - HIJACK THE STARSHIP


Have you seen the stars tonight?
Would you like to go up on A-deck and look at them with me?
Have you seen the stars tonight?
Would you like to go up for a stroll and keep me company?

Did you know
We could go
We are free
Any place
You can think of 
We can be

Have you seen the stars tonight?
Have you looked at all of the galaxy of stars?


What you gonna do when you feel your lady rollin'
How you gonna feel when you see your lady strollin'
On the deck of the starship
With her head hooked into Andromeda
C'mon Hijack
Gotta get back and ahead to the things that matter
Amerika hates her crazies
And you gotta let go you know
gotta let go you know
gotta let go you know
gotta let go you know or else you stay
SPILLIN' OUT OF THE STEEL GLASS
GRAVITY GONE FROM THE CAGE
A MILLION POUNDS GONE FROM YOUR HEAVY MASS
ALL THE YEARS GONE FROM YOUR AGE

Hydroponic gardens and forests
Glistening with lakes in the Jupiter starlite
Room for babies and Byzantine dancing astronauts of renown
The magician and the pantechnicon
Take along the farmer and the physician
We gotta get out and down
Back into the future
Beyond our own time again
Reachin' for tomorrow
It's so fine Starshine
THE MELTING ACID FEVER STREAKIN' THRU MY MIND
MAKES IT OH SO DIFFICULT TO SEE YOU
AND OH SO EASY TO TOUCH YOU
I MELT WITH YOU
FEEL WITH YOU
MAKE LOVE FOR YOU
AT YOU
AROUND YOU
I LOVE YOU

Dear Brumus, the ship'll be ours and you got to roll with it
Though your master's head's blown off you got to go with it
Roll with the natural flow
Like water off a spinning ball
Out - the one remaining way to go
Free - the only way to fall
The light in the night is the sun
And it can carry you around the planetary ground
And the planetary whip of the sun
Will carry you well past Gideon
And the people you see will leave you be
more than the ones you've known before
Hey - rollin' on
We come and go like a comet
We are wanderers
Are you anymore?
The land is green and you make it grow
And you gotta let go you know
You gotta let go you know
You gotta let go you know
Or else you stay
MANKIND GONE FROM THE CAGE
ALL THE YEARS GONE FROM YOUR AGE
At first
I was irridescent
Then
I became transparent
Finally
I was absent


I want to ride the tiger 
I want to ride the tiger 
It will be black and white in the dead of night 
Eyes flashing in the clear moonlight 
I want to ride the tiger. 

It's like a tear in the hands of a western man 
Tell you about salt, carbon and water 
But a tear to a chinese man 
He'll tell you about sadness and sorrow or the love of a man and a woman. 

I want to ride the tiger 
I want to sail through the risin' sun for you and you 
We got something to learn from the other side 
Something to give, we got nothing to hide 
I want to ride the tiger. 

Black wants out of the streets 
Yellow wants the country 
Red wants the country back 
And white wants out of this world 
Sing - sing to the sky 
I want to ride the tiger 
I want to ride the tiger. 

Look to the summer of seventy-five 
All the world is gonna come alive 
Do you want to ride the tiger? 

It's like a tear in the hands of a western man 
Tell you about salt, carbon and water 
But a tear to an oriental man 
He'll tell you about sadness and sorrow or the love of a man and a woman.


Think of the times you have sat by yourself 
And wondered 
Just what it was that compelled you to be 
What you are 
You came into this life unsheltered and all alone 
That's how you came and for sure that's how you go out. 

High on a hill you can feel the breeze 
And rest easy 
All things that live have a right to exist 
And be free. 

You came into this life unsheltered and all alone 
That's how you came and for sure that's how you'll go out 
That's for sure, that's how you go out 
That's for sure, that's how you go out 
That's for sure, that's how you go out 
That's for sure, that's how you go out. 

Is there a chance you have taken these steps 
So not losing 
Losing all that you have, don't you know what you have is not real 
You came into this life unsheltered and all alone 
That's how you came and for sure that's how you go out 
Yeah that's for sure 
That's how you go out 
That's how you go out 
That's how you go out 
That's how you go out.

It's too late - she's gone
It's too late - my baby's gone
Wish I had told her - she was my only one
But it's too late - she's gone

It's a weak man that cries
So I guess I'd best dry my eyes
Guess I will miss her more than any one
But it's too late - she's gone

She's gone - yes, she's gone
She's gone - my my baby's gone
She's gone - yes, she's gone
Where can my baby be

I wonder does she know
When she left me - it hurt me so
I need your lovin' - please don't make me weep
And tell me - it's not too late


Tell me how to keep your love
You know how I need your love
Tell me how you keep the love
Within your heart from me
Don't you know that I love you
Let me show why I'm true blue
When I know our love is true
Don't keep your love from me
If you would say to me today
The time for love is now
Could I sway your love my way
Then I say tell me how
Tell me how to keep your love
You know how I need your love
Tell me how you keep the love
Within your heart from me

If you would say to me today
The time for love is now
Could I sway your love my way
Then I say tell me how
Tell me how to keep your love
You know how I need your love
Tell me how you keep the love
Within your heart from me
Tell me how you keep the love
Within your heart from me


Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die

Well, you give me all your lovin' and your turtle dovin'
All your hugs and kisses and your money too
Well, you know you love me baby
Until you tell me, maybe
That some day, well I'll be through

Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die



Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die

Well, when Cupid shot his dart
He shot it at your heart
So if we ever part and I leave you
You sit and hold me and you tell me boldly
That some day, well I'll be blue

Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die

Well, that'll be the day, hoo-hoo
That'll be the day, hoo-hoo
That'll be the day, hoo-hoo
That'll be the day


Stayin' at home, waitin' for you
Just won't get it 'cause you say we're thru
Well I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
Well if you're not here
But baby, I don't care
Because I'm lookin' for someone to love

Playin' the field all day long
Since I found out I was wronged
Well I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
Well if you're not here
But baby I don't care
'Cause I'm lookin' for someone to love

Caught myself, thinkin' of you
You can't love me and an other one too
Well I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
Well if you're not here
But baby I don't care
Because I'm lookin' for someone to love

Drunk man, street car
Foot slipped, there you are
Well I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm a-lookin' for someone to love
Well if you're not here
But baby I don't care
Because I'm a-lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love


One lonely night at this drive-in
And now I know what a foo-ooll I've been
She was to meet me, we had a da-ate
A date at seven I dreamed of heaven
Now it's way past eight
She just drove by with another guy
No wonder I can't he-elp but cry

To think she never cared just tears me up
Now all I have to show for love
Is this empty cup
Just like this Coke
My love is gone I've hit the bottom
Now I'm all alone


Send me some loving, send it I pray
How can I love you when you're far away

Send me your picture, send it my dear
So I can hold it, pretend you are near

Can't you send me your kisses, I can feel their touch
I need you so badly, I miss you so much

My days are so lonely, my nights are so blue
I'm here and lonely, I'm waiting for you

Can't you send me your kisses, I can feel their touch
I miss you so badly, I need you so much

My days are so lonely, my nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm lonely, I'm waiting for you

When I was young and in my prime (in my prime!),
I left my home in Caroline.
Now all I do is sit and pine, for all those folks I left behind.

I got the Blue Ridge mountain blues, and I sat right here to say,
"My grip is packed to travel, and I'm back to ramble,
To my Blue Ridge far away."

I'm goin' to stay right by my Pa, I'm goin' to do right by my Ma,
I'll hang around the cabin door, no work or worry anymore.

I got the Blue Ridge mountain blues, goin' to see my old oak tree,
Gonna hunt the possum where the corn cob blossom,
In my Blue Ridge far away.
Woo!

I see a haze of snowy white, I see a window with light,
I seem to hear them both sigh, "Where is my wand'rin boy tonight?"

I got the Blue Ridge mountain blues, and I stay right here to say,
"Every day I'm countin' 'til I climb that mountain,
In my Blue Ridge far away."


Ohhhh, when He calls my name, I will ah-ah-a-answer,
When He calls, calls me yeah, I will ah-ah-a-answer,
When He calls my name, I will ah-ah-a-answer,
Wanna be somewhere, yeah Lord, call my name!

I wanna be somewhere, Lord, yeah Lord call my name.
Wanna be somewhere-hair yeah Lord call my name.
On that day we shall rise, wipe the tears from my eyes,
I wanna be somewhere, yeah Lord call my name!

Mmm, I say "Lord, you know I don't have no friend like you,
If Heaven's not my home, please tell me what shall I do?"
Somebody sendin' for your child to lay Heaven, oh but soon
I'm goin' to be somewhere, yeah call my name.

Oh, I wanna be somewhere, Lord when He calls my name,
I wanna be somewhere, Lord when He calls, calls my name,
Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down, sometimes leveled to the ground,
I wanna be somewhere, Somewhere! Somewhere! Somewhere!
Somewhere! Somewhere! Somewhere!
Call my name, my name.


I lay here at night, toss and I turn, lovin' you so, how my heart yearns,
Honey, you're the reason I don't sleep at night.
A-justa walkin' the floor, thinkin' of you, smoke cigarettes, and drink all day too,
Honey, you're the reason I can't sleep at night.

I'm bettin' you're not losin' sleep over me, but if I'm wrong don't fail to call,
Come over and keep me-hee company.
Sometimes I go for a walk, look at the moon, strum my guitar to some old lonesome tune,
Honey, you're the reason I can't sleep at night.

I'm bettin' you're not losin' sleep over me, yeah but if I'm wrong don't fail to call,
Come over and keep me-hee company.
Sometimes I go for a walk, look at the moon, strum my guitar and sing out of tune,
Honey, you're the reason I can't sleep at night.
Honey, you're the reason I can't sleep at night.
Honey, you're the reason I can't sleep at night.


Goodbye, Joe, me gotta go, me oh my oh.
Me gotta go, pole the pirogue down the bayou.
My Yvonne, sweetest one, me oh my oh.
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou.


Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio.
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo,
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou.

Thibodeaux, Fontaineaux, the place is buzzin',
Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen.
Dress in style, go hog wild, and be gayo.
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou.


Oh, guitar!



Oh, Lord!
Hang tight, ooh Lord!
Ah, take it out.
He's comin', ah!


Just because I asked a friend about her, just because I spoke her name somewhere,
Just because I dialled her number by mistake today, she thinks I still care.

Just because I haunt the same old places, where the memory of her lingers everywhere,
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be, she thinks I still care.

Oh if she's happy thinkin' I still need her, then let that silly notion bring her cheer,
Oh how could she ever be so foolish, and where would she get such an idea?

Just because I asked a friend about her, just because I spoke her name somewhere,
Just because I saw her, then went all to pieces, she thinks I still care.
She thinks I still caaaaaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaare.


I'm goin' to California, where they sleep out every night, yeah.
I'm goin' to California, where they sleep out every night, yeah.
I'm leavin' you, Mama, 'cause you know you don't treat me right.

Let me tell you somethin', Mama that you don't know,
Let me tell you somethin', good gal that you don't know,
Yeah, I'm a do-right Papa, and got a home everywhere I go.

I got the California blues, and I'm sure gonna leave here, Lord, Lord.
I got the California blues, and I'm sure gonna leave you here,
I may rob you blind, I ain't got not railroad fare.
Come on in here.

Listen to me, Mama, while I sing this song, Lord.
Listen to your Daddy sing you this lonesome song.
You got me worried now, but I won't be worried long.

I got the California blues, and I'm sure gonna leave here, hey, hey, hey.
I got the California blues, and I'm sure gonna leave you here,
I may rob you blind, I ain't got not railroad fare.
Honey, get over here.

Mold me and make me, after Thy will,
While I am waiting, yielded and still.

Search me and try me, Master today,
Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,
As in Thy presence humbly I bow.

Wounded and weary, help me I pray,

Touch me and heal me, Saviour divine.

Wellllllll, I ain't never, I ain't never, seen nobody like you,
No no never, have I ever, seen nobody like you-oo-oo.

You call me up, say you'll meet me at nine,
I have to hurry, hurry, but I'm there on time,
I walk right up and knock on your door,
The landlord says "She ain't here no more."


I ain't never, oh darlin', seen nobody like you-oo-oo,
But I love ya, yeah I love ya, I love you just the same.

Well, you tell me things that you don't mean,
You got me livin' in a haunted dream,
You make me do things, I don't wanna do,
My friends they stay away, but what's so wrong with you?


I love you just the same.


>> robertplant

Slipped through the window by the back door
Caught short in transit with my love
Jumped up, fell back, cut off from romance,
How could I fall without a shove
Tip-toed like thunder on my feelings
You rock me gently with your sighs
My knees are weak - my head is reeling
Consumed by the fire in your eyes
Stepped in and shattered my defences,
Just playing hookey with my heart
Slipped through the window by the back door
And took the keys to my poor heart, yes my poor heart

Try as I might - try as I may
Yes I'll try anything to make you stay
Cause I need your love - yes I need your love --
I'm looking high - I'm looking low,
Can't find where did my baby go
Gotta find out why she ran away
I don't know where did my baby stay
Try as I might - try as I may
Yes I'll try anything to make you stay

Fire down the Boulevard d'Amour
Shoot through the neon in the night
Hot foot through alleys - check the doorways
Try that old parking lot on Ninth
There's three-course kissing in the same place
But that don't help me out no more
I've been away so long and dreaming
Little girl ain't I seen you before


Time and again I see you walking down the street
Over and over, just like before
Once in a while you stop and say hello to me
Just like you used to do before
Time and again, it's like we were in love and then
Over and over - nobody keeping score
Once in a while I think you notice when I smile
That love still lingers in my eyes

It can't go wrong, it can't go wrong
It lingers on, it lingers on

Day after day I turn it over in my mind
Dream after dream it's hard to tell you how I find
Out of the blue I'm suddenly so close to you
Despite the years that I've been gone
Will you stop - will you wait a minute - please remember
Can you stop - can you just give me one minute to explain
I will not cause a fuss, I will not rock the boat - believe me darling
Oh what is, what was, it's all the same


Watch them go 'cause one by one they rise to fall
Hearts in tow, it's just a game - she's only having fun
She laughs and turns away surprised
She mocks it all the same
Tonight's the loss tomorrow's gain and in the end it's so

Stand in line as one by one they march in time
In the wings I stand and watch these foolish things go by
Just preparing for the play aloof she moves
The confidante, with practiced step
The merry dance she executes her role

As the cavalcade begins to thin, do you stop and look around
Free to choose but not to win - you're just too late
Your show is at an end - now you're the victim of your game
Through your fingers watch them slip
Familiar rules just hit and miss for the one who never shows


Slow dancer - no answers
For you new moves to see
Fast talker in dark corners
For you new words to hear
Sly glances - half chances
For you the eye that sees

When the sun slips from the day and the coolness brings relief
There's no torment 'neath the stars in the stillness of the night
When the swirling has to cease behind the safety of the veil

In high places - darkened faces
So indifferent in days to be
Lost races - no losers
Only winners return to see
New order - can't be altered
When the eyes refuse to see

When the sun slips from the day 

Soft spoken - never could be broken
Waiting the dawn light with me
Slow burning - school of learning
Don't hasten it down on me
Hearts leaping - hopes been reaching
To the heights, to the heights - these signs to see

Oh baby -- in the darkness, in the darkness --


Operator, give me Central, Central
Help me try to get my baby on the line
Information, hear me calling, calling
Find that number, give it to me one more time
It's been so long since I saw her
Anything I'd give to hear the little girl of mine
Whatever it takes, got to make it, make it
Please connect me now before I lose my mind
Because I don't know, no I don't know what I'm gonna do
No I don't know, no I don't know what I'm gonna do

Tastes so good, sweet as honey, honey
All she carries is impossible to use
It's built for speed man, watch her coming, coming
Moves so fast in someone else's shoes
Looks so fine lord, watch them running
Anything she wants you feel obliged to do
Keep your hands in your pockets
She can shift more gold than the king of Peru
But I don't know, no I don't know what I'm gonna do
No I don't know, no I don't know what I'm gonna do

Man drinks whisky, drive him crazy in time
Woman sits and cries as day will follow day
Man need lovin', keep him happy sometime
Woman gets some when the honeydripper's on his way
But I don't know, no I don't know what I'm gonna do
But I don't know, but I don't know --
No I don't know, no I don't know, no I don't know
She can do it, she can do it, she can do it babe
She's sweet as honey, sweet as honey, sweet as honey --


I can't believe it, it happens each day
It's ill conceived, just throw it away
To watch the waiting time slipping away
It won't be long now

I hold the moment, the hour is sublime
It's hard believing, dancing with time
To watch the waiting time slipping away
It won't be long now

Down at the landing when the boats come in
People stand in line
Close by the water where the fishes swim
Round and round to pass the time
But you know it's gonna get there
Around and around it's gonna spin

Out at the airport where the planes come in
People buzzing like flies
Out at the airport where the planes come in
See the hours go flashing by
But you know it's gonna get there
Around and around it's gonna spin

Down at the station where the trains come in
Never make it on time
Down at the station where the trains come in
See my friends all walk the line
But you know they're gonna get there
Around and around they're gonna spin

View it all with suspicion, view it all and despise
View it all with suspicion, view it all with my eyes


I'll see you baby, when the ice has broken
When the rain stops falling down
I'll be waiting for you, baby when your time has come
And your face no longer frowns
I caught a taste of springtime on your lips
I saw the sunlight in your eyes

I wake to find you smiling with the dawn
Just reminders of the time
I feel your breath, I look around but you're gone
I see the place where you were lying
I caught a taste of springtime on your lips
I see the sunlight in your eyes

It's been so long, it's been so long, so long, since you've been gone
I look away, I can see that you're gone
I guess I'm standing here alone

Across the sea, I see bluebirds on high
In the wildest places too
Above the ground the wind is calling out to me
Oh, lead me back to you
I caught a taste of springtime on your lips
I can still see the sunlight in your eyes, in your eyes

It's been so long 

Well I'll see you baby, when the ice has broken
When the rain stops falling down
I'll be waiting for you, baby when your time has come
And your face no longer frowns
And I caught a taste of springtime on your lips
I saw the sunlight in your eyes, in your eyes

I can see, I can see, I can see that it's true
Just like, just like I've never been gone --


Had to leave in a hurry, couldn't wait to get away
It's not a case of being sorry, it's the price I have to pay
Confidentially I think it's sad, but there's nothing I can do
If the road leads to the highway, well I'm hot and I've got to move
Ah-ha I've got to move

Got to change my arrangements, had the word I'm on my way
Couldn't stand it much longer, got the move, I'm on my way
I didn't mean to let you down but there's nothing I can do
If the road leads to the highway, well I'm hot and I've got to move
I'm hot and I've got to move

Talk of strain in relations, of the days of being confused
You told me never to worry, I'll never ask you to choose
Categorically I have to say it's as much as I can do
To sit around here waiting, when I'm hot and I've got to move

Oh, sometimes it's lonely - but it's the only way I know
And the road is leading me on
Ooh baby, I've got to move, yes
Oh, now baby baby, I've got to leave
And when I think back I smile and know that win or lose
It's the road that's calling me on
Ooh, baby baby I've got to move, yes
Ooh, baby baby I've got to move, yeah

There's a man in a suitcase, standing in a darkened room
Message light is burning, and the blinds are always drawn
It's been a while since the last time, never should come back too soon
Behind, the door is slamming, when he's hot he's got to move
When he's hot he's got to move


Lay down your arms - now baby, let me sleep at night
Lay down your arms baby - I'll make everything all right
Words you been using, hurting me so
Some day your gonna regret
Your friends are talking - guess you never know
There's not a lately one yet

Lay down your arms, baby - when the deal is done
Lay down your arms, child - used to be your only one
Weapon you're using is hurting me bad
What do you hope to achieve
I said your fighting is leaving me sad
That's not the way it should be

Find a love - find a way
Find a dream - find a way
You know that I will, yes you know

Lay down your arms - please release me, let me go
Lay down your arms, baby - now surrender to me, don't you know

Find a love - find a way
Find a dream - find a way
You know that I, you know that I
You know I will, but you know

Oh, she's gone, she's gone
I'm not a prisoner - I'm the big beret
I'm not a prisoner - I'm the big beret
I'm not a prisoner - I'm the big beret
No I'm not
Oh, oh my baby's gone
Lay down your arms
I don't know where I'm gonna find her
'Cause my baby's gone
Lay down your arms
Is she here, is she there, is she here, yes I know
Oh, I gotta find her


I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood

I can make you dance - I can make you sing
I can make you dance - I can make you sing
If you want me to
I can make you dance - I can make you sing
I can make you dance - I can make you sing
If you want me to
I can make you dance - I can make you sing
I can make you dance - I can make you sing
If you want me to

Any little song that you want to sing
Little songs that you want to sing
Any song will do
Any little song that you want to sing
Little songs that you want to sing
It's up to you
Little songs that you want to sing
A little song that you want to sing
You're blue

I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood

I can write it on the door - I can put it on the floor
I can do anything that you want me for
If you want me to
I can do it right - I can do it wrong
'Cause a matter of fact it'll turn out to be strong
If you want me to

In the shadow of the moon,

She danced in the starlight

Whispering a haunting tune

To the night...

Velvet skirts spun 'round and 'round

Fire in her stare

In the woods without a sound

No one cared...

Through the darkened fields entranced,

Music made her poor heart dance,

Thinking of a lost romance...

Long ago...

Feeling lonely, feeling sad,

She cried in the moonlight.

Driven by a world gone mad

She took flight...

"Feel no sorrow, feel no pain,

Feel no hurt, there's nothing gained...

Only love will then remain,"

She would say.

Shadow of the Moon...

Shadow of the Moon...

Shadow of the Moon...

Shadow of the Moon...



Through the darkened fields entranced,

Music made her poor heart dance,

Thinking of a lost romance...

Long ago...



Somewhere just beyond the mist

Spirits were seen flying

As the lightning led her way

Through the dark...



In the shadow of the moon,

She danced in the starlight

Whispering a haunting tune

To the night...



Shadow of the Moon...

Shadow of the Moon...

Shadow of the Moon...

Shadow of the Moon...

Shadow of the Moon...

Shadow of the Moon...

Shadow of the Moon...

Shadow of the Moon...


As the wind chimes play along the breeze

Singing songs to stir the soul,

Rainbow colours entwined in fairytales

On the maypole...

Sing the song of lands from far away,

Other times and another place,

The wind can carry us all away from here

Charmed in her embrace...

Leaves turn to red, the nights are getting colder,

Seasons will change, the clock ticks on...

Leaves fill the trees as the days are getting warmer,

Days turn to years, the clocks ticks on...

A cloak and dagger, no fear of freedom

When hearts beat in another time,

Ever changing, the clock ticks on,

If only in your mind...

The wind has died and the chimes are still again

The trees stand tall as they cover me in shade

In the mirror a maiden stares at me

As the secret fades...

And though the clock ticks on to the future

It's in the past my heart will stay

In a time so far away from me

I'll return someday...


Be mine tonight,

We'll travel through all our memories,

In our own little space in time,

You've always been mine...



Through the years,

I feel your love beside me

Through the laughter and the tears,

You've conquered all my fears...



So many stories,

So many treasures,

So much our lives have shared...

We've done it all and we've done it together,

You know I've always cared...



In this heart,

There'll never be another,

You have made my life complete,

Our love is like a dream...



Take my hand,

Nothing can come between us,

We were always meant to be,

Forever, you and me...



In my eyes,

Your face is always before me,

Our souls are now as one...

We've only just begun


Underneath the harvest moon

Where the ancient shadows will play and hide...

With a ghostly tune and the devil's pride...

"Stranger" whispered all the town

Has he come to save us from Satan's hand?

Leading them away to a foreign land...

Play for me, minstrel, play

And take away our sorrows...

Play for me, minstrel, play

And we'll follow...

Hear, listen, can you hear,

The haunting melody surrounding you,

Weaving a magic spell all around you...

Weaving a magic spell all around you...

Danger hidden in his eyes,

We should have seen it from far away,

Wearing such a thin disguise in the light of day...

He held the answer to our prayers,

Yet it was too good to be...

Proof before our eyes, yet we could not see...

Play for me, minstrel, play

And take away our sorrows...

Play for me, minstrel, play

And we'll follow...

Hear, listen, can you hear,

The haunting melody surrounding you,

Weaving a magic spell all around you...

Weaving a magic spell all around you...


Ooooooooooohh....

Ooooooooooohh....



Tried to take it all away,

Learn her freedom... just inside a day,

And find her soul to find there fears are laid...

Tried to make her love their own,

They took her love... they left her there,

They gave her nothing back that she would want to own...



Gold and silver rings and stones,

Dances slowly off the moon,

No one else could know, she stands alone...

Sleeping dreams will reach for her,

She can not say the words they need,

She knows she's alone and she is free...



Ocean Gypsy of the moon,

The sun has made a thousand nights for you to hold...

Ocean Gypsy where are you?

The shadows followed by the stars have turned to gold...



Turned to gold...



Then she met a hollow soul,

Filled him with her light and was consoled,

She was the moon and he the sun was gold...

Eyes were blinded with his light...

The sun she gave reflected back the night

The moon was waning almost out of sight...



Softly Ocean Gypsy calls...

Silence holds the stars a while,

They smile sadly for her where she falls...

Just the time before the dawn,

The sea is hushed the ocean calls her,

Day has taken her and now she's gone...



Ocean Gypsy of the moon,

The sun has made a thousand nights for you to hold...

Ocean Gypsy where are you?

The shadows followed by the stars have turned to gold...



Turned to gold...



Ooooooo...oooooooooo....



No one noticed when she died,

Ocean Gypsy shackled to the tide,

The ebbing waves, the turning spreading white...



Something gone within her eyes,

Her fingers, lifeless, stroked the sand,

Her battered soul was lost,

She was abandonned...



Silken threads like wings still shine,

Wind swept pleasures still make patterns

in her lovely hair... so dark and fine...

Stands on high beneath the seas, cries no more,

her tears have dried...

Oceans weep for her, the ocean sighs...



Ocean Gypsy of the moon,

The sun has made a thousand nights for you to hold...

Ocean Gypsy where are you?

The shadows followed by the stars have turned to gold...



Turned to gold...

Turned to gold...

Turned to gold...

Turned to gold......


I called your name out loud in the courtyard,

The crystal I held was like an old friend

The vines crawled the walls

The wind held its breath

But the answer I longed for never came...

Your name, they had said, was cursed beyond measure,

The families at odds fought with poisoned tongues

And yet through the dark,

Of blind, bitter hate,

Broke a glittering light of two lover's fate...



Walls built between us,

Miles separate us,

Yet in our hearts, we share the same dream...

Feelings so strong,

We just must carry on,

On to our Magical World...



Destiny called them like a silver poem

They followed the dance 'till the music died out...

Last time they met was on an earth bed

Both knowing they'd meet again in the light...



Walls built between us,

Miles separate us,

Yet in our hearts, we share the same dream

Feelings so strong

We just must carry on,

On to our Magical World...



In our Magical World... In our Magical World...



Fear not, dear Juliet, your Romeo's calling

He's waiting for you at the end of the song,

This world was too cruel... for lovers like you,

But here in our hearts you'll always live on... 



Walls built between us,

Miles separate us,

Yet in our hearts, we share the same dream...

Feelings so strong,

We just must carry on,

On to our Magical World...



Walls built between us,

Miles separate us,

Yet in our hearts, we share the same dream...

Feelings so strong,

We just must carry on,

On to our Magical, Magical, Magical, World...

(Between us)

(So strong)



On to our Magical, Magical, Magical, World...


Is it powers of intuition?

Is it insecurity?

You know I can read your mind and

You have been deceiving me...

Which face wears the masque this evening?

When will your true colors show?

Will they be as black as shadows

Hiding 'neath the rainbow...

Had my heart on a silver chain

With the words engraved

"I loved you"...

Like a swan that was lost at sea

I lost all of me

To you...

Now I see the writing on the wall...

Paranoia or perception?

Put your faith in a liar's hands

Wanting to believe his words

But never knowing where he stands...

There's too many misconceptions

In this game of consequence

When you're finding that your hero

Is just who you're up against:


I was told once, by a friend of mine,

She had seen an olden sign,

Said she was not from this time,

And did I feel the same?

So I told her, "Yes", I knew her fear

As I felt the truth draw near

Told her back three hundred years,

Was the time that I held dear...



Gather lords and ladies fair,

Come with me to the Renaissance Faire

Hurry now,

We're almost there...

Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la...



Through the shroud of mystery,

Turn a page of history,

Feeling more than you can see,

Down at the Renaissance Faire.

Hear the minstrels play their tunes,

They will play the whole night through,

Special songs for me and for you,

And anyone whose heart is true...



Gather lords and ladies fair,

Come with me to the Renaissance Faire

Hurry now,

We're almost there...

Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la...



There's too many stars for one sky to hold,

Some will fall, others are sold,

As the fields turn to gold

Down at the Renaissance Faire...



Gather lords and ladies fair,

Come with me to the Renaissance Faire

Hurry now,

We're almost there...

Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la...



Gather lords and ladies fair,

Come with me to the Renaissance Faire

Hurry now,

Gather lords and ladies fair,

Come with me to the Renaissance Faire

Hurry now,

My diamond's clouded over where it used to shine like light,

And the day keeps running faster,

Into the arms of night...

The stitches on the tapestry say,

"Everything in time,

Will find it's way home again,"

But I'm tired of crying...

No Second Chances

Don't knock on my door

There won't be any answer

I won't be here no more...

This house we had together

Might still be in its place

But the rest of this is much too hard to face,

There'll be No Second Chance...

Lovely moonlit hours we spent

Walking on the beach,

We'd gaze up at the stars,

I swear they were in our reach...

But time... it went on,

Minutes... they ran too fast.

Like you they were gone...

Into the past....


I took a walk along the shore

To clear my mind about the day,

I saw a man I'd seen before

As I approached, he slipped away...



I knew his face from years ago,

His smile stays with me ever more

His eyes, they guide me through the haze

And give me shelter from the storm...





As I walk I can feel him,

Always watching over me...

His voice surrounds me,

My Spirit of the Sea...



He went away so long ago,

On a maiden voyage far away

A young man then I did not know,

His life was taken that same day...



And it was almost like he knew

He wouldn't see me anymore

He looked so deeply in my eyes, and said

"Wait for me along the shore..."







And so I come most every day,

To watch the waves rise and fall,

And as I sit here on the sand,

This ocean makes me feel so small...



But I feel my lover by my side,

And he makes me follow my own heart

We'll be together some sweet day

When that day comes we'll never part...

When that day comes we'll never part...

Wait for me along the shore...

Walkin' down this rocky road
Wondering where my life is leadin'
Rollin' on to the bitter end
Finding out along the way
What it takes to keep love living
You should know how it feels, my friend

Ooh, I want you to stay
Ooh, I want you today

I'm ready for love
Oh baby, I'm ready for love
Ready for love
Oh baby, I'm ready for love

Now I'm on my feet again
Better things are bound to happen
All my dues surely must be paid
Many miles and many tears
Times were hard but now they're changing
You should know that I'm not afraid

Ooh, I want you to stay
Ooh, I want you today

I'm ready for love
Oh baby, I'm ready for love
I'm ready for love
Oh baby, I'm ready for love
Oh, for your love


If I had a love that was so true
Then I wouldn't have to make do
With the half a love that I have found
That is tearing me down to the ground

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, tell me love can be found

If I had a love that was so real
And who would know the way I feel
I want all your love today
Just to keep me from fading away

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, tell me love can be found


Company, always on the run
Destiny is the rising sun
Oh, I was born a shotgun in my hands
Behind the gun I'll make my final stand
That's why they call me

Bad company
And I can't deny
Bad company
Till the day I die
Oh, till the day I die
Till the day I die

Rebel souls, deserters we are called
Chose a gun and threw away the sun

The death punch sound, is our claim to fame
That's why they call me

Bad company
I can't deny
Bad, bad company
Till the day I die,
Untill the day I die,
Untill the day I die,
Untill the day I die

Eye for an eye
Tooth for a tooth
Blood for blood
We've all gotta die
We've all gotta die

That's why they call me
Bad company
I won't deny
Bad, bad company
Till the day I die

Bad company
I won't deny
Bad, bad company
Till the day I die
Untill the day I die
Untill the day I die
Untill the day I die

UNTILL THE DAY I DIE


I live my life the way that I choose
I'm satisfied, nothing to lose
I don't ask no favors, I don't know the reason why
If I don't ask no questions, I don't get no lies

Every way that you move is closer to me
I don't need nobody to tell me the reason why
If I love only you baby, I'll be satisfied

I don't need nobody to tell me the reason why
If I love only you baby I'll be satisfied
You know I'll be satisfied

Seagull, you fly across the horizon
Into the misty morning sun. 
Nobody asks you where you are going,
Nobody knows where you're from.

I woke up from my sleep to the sound of that voice

From the words that I heard I had no choice

They told me I had to turn around

My assurance slowly faded down

And I wonder



Will I ever make it home

Will I ever leave the ground

Leave this place so far behind



The plans that I had were quickly destroyed

The problem was one I couldn't avoid

They welcomed me to stay overnight

I'm too tired to complain so i just might

And I wonder



Will I ever make it home

To the place I recognize

Far from here and where I've been

And all the places that I've been shown

Will I ever make it home

Can they keep me here for good

Where I hardly know a soul

And my fear keeps going on



My weariness keeps growing inside

My patience is starting to subside

And I hope I'll be there soon

It can't be long or I'll fall through



Will I ever make it home

Will I ever leave the ground

Leave this place so far behind

Till there is no turning back

Will I ever make it home 

Get to where I wanna be

Find the ones who wait for me

To the place where I belong

Will I ever make it home


Maybe her eyes are just a little bit red

Almost all the time

Maybe her hair, it smells like cigarettes

When I climb into bed with her at night



She don't wanna try

But this just feels so right



She's almost perfect

She is so close to being everything

She's almost perfect

But she's not, she's not mine



Maybe she knows she drives me crazy

Just bats her eyes like she's my baby

Maybe she's quick to let her tongue fly at me

She's not the most proper lady

I'm the one to blame I know I caused this crash

So now I wander in this mess

Int this lake of sour mashed

Through my head the notion that



Maybe she's not quite honest with me

Almost all the time

Maybe I know there's someone else in her life

When I climb into bed with her at night


Stop weeping for your loss, it's over now

He's finally gone for good.  I hope he's better off

Stop praying for forgiveness, in Heaven he can't

Hit the bottle or his wife, it's gotta be for the best  



Oh please don't cry

I beg you not to weep

You are your brother's keeper

But your brother now, your brother won't keep   



His life wasn't in your hands, there's things here that are

Far beyond your control, death's one of life's demands

Don't worry you're not to blame, don't worry it's no one's fault  



Oh  please don't cry

I beg you not to weep

You are your brother's keeper

But your brother now, your brother won't keep  



What a waste, what a waste

A life filled up with empty rage

What a waste, what a waste

I hope your soul is cleansed when you reach that place  



Oh please don't cry

I beg you not to weep

You are your brother's keeper

But your brother now, your brother won't keep


'Bout that time again

Strange feelin' in the wind

Standin' in this place

Starin' face to face

But we don't see eye to eye

Somehow all the blame is mine

You're doin' nothin' wrong

You say all your trust is gone  



Yeah you gotta tell me what you want 'cause I can't see through your mind

Oh you gotta hit me with it baby show me what's deep inside  



The trouble's got me where it wants me

But that won't be enough to end me

I've said it times before, you ain't gonna walk on me no more

You really don't know how to treat me

You're lucky you still hung onto me

But next time your luck runs out, and that's the day I'm walkin' out your door  



I'm beggin' baby please

You must believe in me

Hear too many lies

Don't know which way to side

But I tell you I'm the truth

There's a chance for me and you

But you've got to close your eyes

And leave this far behind


A dark clear sky above our heads

You're tongue is cold but still your heart it bleeds for something more

Bittersweet memories from my bed

Haunt your world of trust that crumbles in between my hands  



But still I see there's no way out

You think you've gone somewhere, but there's no way I'm leaving you behind  



So I'm goin' now but you know that I'll come back

You know I don't give up that easy

But before you think I'm gone for good

Our story's not yet over, the timing's just not right for me tonight  



A common life just shoved aside

Uncommon bearing of a word that's just been thrown around

Rescued by our senseless style

Without a chance you say you're tired of all this pain inside  



Tonight you turned your eyes from me

But there's some things that you don't see

You can't get what you want from me right now


Streetlights blind my eyes through a shade

that's halfway pulled

Cracklin' right side interrupts the radio in my head

Speeding through a familiar town that I don't know all too well

I find a glimpse of you outside my home



If you ever want to come home from Chicago

And leave the things that habit made you love

I'll be there to await your arrival

To give you a life you'll never know



Sometimes I get the feeling that I'm not the only one

Sometimes my silence speaks for itself

As I stroll on down the street I pray for a chance

I'll see you ther

This time I think I'll share my life with you


On the radio this morning

They played our song

Thought about the good times

And I wonder what went wrong

Miscommunication?

Or cause you had no faith in me

Lack of inspiration?

Or maybe, maybe it's just me



There's life that surrounds me

But still I cannot see

I just can't make my heart fall

For beauty endlessly

I don't know what I'm feeling

It's not right, it can't be

I try to find someone to blame

But maybe, maybe it's just me



Maybe you were right to find your way out of my life

You found comfort elsewhere while I held on way too tight

But I find no reason why I can't be satisfied

Perhaps cause I can't have you


The weather says the sun won't shine

And I've arrested my free time

No bottle here to ease my mind

My rationale has just run wild  



But when I see your smiling face

I know I would not trade my place

I tell you girl I'm so in love with you  



Sometimes I think that you don't see

The difference between you and me

Sometimes you got to let me be

I know the truth will set you free  



But when I see your smiling face

I know I would not trade my place

I tell you girl I'm so in love with you  



I've been where the sun don't shine

I've been arrested once or twice

A bottle's helped me lose my mind

I've seen it done a thousand times


Streetlights blind my eyes through a shade

that's halfway pulled

Cracklin' right side interrupts the radio in my head

Speeding through a familiar town that I don't know all too well

I find a glimpse of you outside my home



If you ever want to come home from Chicago

And leave the things that habit made you love

I'll be there to await your arrival

To give you a life you'll never know



Sometimes I get the feeling that I'm not the only one

Sometimes my silence speaks for itself

As I stroll on down the street I pray for a chance

I'll see you ther

This time I think I'll share my life with you


She takes another morning drive

She wonders if she's right this time

She dreams about a life in other scenes

She says it when I'm not around

She drinks herself all over town

And finds a way to live in misery



And it's all I need

To save myself

And leave



Tell her I'm ok

And she knows everything, everything I'll say

Tell her it's a shame

'Cause I believe, my Love, you'll never be the same



She lays awake, alone at night

She can't forget with all her might

She left a love that only you could see

Now she's sorry, desperate, feeling blue

She dreams about a life with you

The other side ain't always what it seems


>> harper

Well you can need me 

Well I want you to

And you can feed me

How I like that too

But don't you lead me

I won't follow you

Listen here

I don't fear

I don't want to be your

Whipping boy



You can tease me

How I want you to

And you can squeeze me

Baby I like that too

But don't you lead me

I won't follow you

Listen here

I don't fear

I don't want to be your

Whipping boy



You can hold me 

Baby I want you to

And you can scold me

Yes I like that too

But don't you lead me

I won't follow you

Listen here

I don't fear

I don't want to be your 

Whipping boy



Well you can need me

Well I want you to

And you can feed me 

Baby I like that too

But don't you lead me

I won't follow you

Listen here 

I don't fear

I don't want to be your 

Whipping boy


You don't believe that I love you

And even if that was true

Why just to keep our unhappy home

I'm gonna try to pretend that I do

But I'm breakin' down

I'm breakin' down

I'm breakin' down

I'm breakin' down

My baby she left me 

said she ain't comin' back around

and I'm breakin' down

I'm breakin' down



And if I thought that it was okay

For a grown man to cry

I would have filled up the whole mighty ocean

When she said goodbye

and I'm breakin' down

I'm breakin' down

I'm breakin' down

I'm breakin' down

You know my baby she left me 

said she ain't comin' back around 

and I'm breakin' down

I'm breakin' down



One day you said everything was just right

I don't see how it changed overnight

One day you said everything was so strong

The next day you turn to me and say 

It' s been wrong all along



Oh and now you won't even look at me

You pass me by in the street and you won't even speak 

I never meant to cause you any harm

How could two people start so close

And end up so far

I'm breakin' down

I'm breakin' down

I'm breakin' down

I'm breakin' down


You say what's mine is mine

And what's yours is mine too

Now you've got more than you can spend

But all of the money 

In the whole wide world

Is not gonna help you in the end

Now while there's still time to be saved

Don't take that attitude to your grave

Might be too late for you I'm afraid

Don't take that attitude to your grave

Don't you take it there



I hear helicopters 

Over my house every day

Shining their lights and flying low

Treat a child like a criminal 

From the day that he is born

And you're gonna reap just what you sow 

Now while there's still time to be saved

Don't take that attitude to your grave

Might be too late for you I'm afraid

Don't take that attitude to your grave

Don't you take it there



So you can move your court case

Way across town

You can move it across the whole wide globe

But it ain't gonna help your court case

Up in the sky

When you go to put on your white robe

Now while there's still time to be saved

Don't take that attitude to your grave

Might be too late for you I'm afraid

They don't want it there

Don't you take it there



And you dare the children 

To stay off of drugs

Now I dare you to stop letting them in

And how dare you point your finger

At a gang out on the street

While it's you who is committing the sin 

Now while there's still time to be saved

Don't take that attitude to your grave

Might be too late for you I'm afraid

Don't take that attitude to your grave

Don't you take it there

They don't want it there

You know your mother taught you better

Don't take that attitude to your grave


Waiting on an angel

One to carry me home

Hope you come to see me soon

Cause I don' t want to go alone

I don' t want to go alone



Now angel won' t you come by me

Angel hear my plea

Take my hand lift me up

So that I can fly with thee

So that I can fly with thee



And I'm waiting on an angel

And I know it won' t be long

To find myself a resting place

In my angel's arms

In my angel's arms



So speak kind to a stranger

Cause you'll never know

It just might be an angel come

Knockin' at your door

Knockin' at your door



And I'm waiting on an angel

And I know it won't be long

To find myself a resting place

In my angel's arms

In my angel's arms



Waiting on an angel

One to carry me home

Hope you come and see me soon

Cause I don' t want to go alone

I don't want to go alone

Don' t want to go

I don't want to go alone


Papa he left home today

Said he ain't comin' back again

Said he ain't gonna be nobody's second best

Just cause mama's got a special kind of friend



Papa he left home today

Said he ain't comin' back no more

Said he ain't gonna take no damn back seat

And how could mama do him so low



But mama's got a girlfriend now boy

Mama's got a girlfriend now

Mama's got a girlfriend

Mama's got a true friend

Mama's got a girlfriend now



You see mama don't watch your damn football

And your beer drinkin' just won't do

You're just stayin' out late

And you're preachin' the hate

And you never have been true



You see mama she want her somebody

Who will let her be herself

So she's leavin' you 

And your stinky damn ways

Cause she's found somebody else



And mama's got a girlfriend now boy

Mama's got a girlfriend now

Mama's got a girlfriend

Mama's found a true friend

Mama's got a girlfriend now



Papa he left home today

He was wavin' his hands and cryin'

You could tell by the sound 

And the tone in his voice

That his heart was slowly dyin'

But mama said "Boy if I ever

Catch you 'round here again

You ain't never gonna have nobody else

Not a woman or a man"



And mama's got a girlfriend now boy

Mama's got a girlfriend now

Mama's got a girlfriend

Mama found a true friend

Mama's got a girlfriend now

Mama's got a girlfriend now boy 

Mama's got a girlfriend now

Mama's got a girlfriend 

Mama's found a true friend

Mama's got a girlfriend now


Not talkin' 'bout a year

No not three or four

I don't want that kind of forever

In my life anymore

Forever always seems 

to be around when it begins

but forever never seems 

to be around when it ends

So give me your forever

Please your forever

Not a day less will do From you



People spend so much time

Every single day

Runnin' 'round all over town

Givin' their forever away

But no not me

I won't let my forever roam

and now I hope I can find

my forever a home

So give me your forever

Please your forever

Not a day less will do

From you



Like a handless clock with numbers

An infinite of time 

No not the forever found 

Only in the mind

Forever always seems 

to be around when things begin

but forever never seems 

to be around when things end

So give me your forever

Please your forever

Not a day less will do

From you


Well Martin's dream

Has become Rodney's worst

Nightmare

Can't walk the streets

To them we are fair game

Our lives don't mean a thing

Like a king, like a king, like a king

Rodney King, Rodney King, Rodney King

Like a king, like a king, like a king 

How I wish you could help us Dr. King

Make sure it's filmed

Shown on national T.V.

They'll have no mercy

A legal lynch mob

Like the days strung up from the tree

The L.A.P.D.

Like a king, like a king, like a king 

Rodney King, Rodney King, Rodney King

Like a king, like a king, like a king

How I wish you could help us Dr. King

So if you catch yourself 

Thinking it has changed for the best

You better second guess

Cause Martin's dream

Has become Rodney's worst

Nightmare

Like a king, like a king, like a king

Rodney King, Rodney King, Rodney King

Like a king, like a king, like a king

How I wish you could help us Dr. King


I'm leaving here on the morning train

And I will never see this world again

I've felt pleasure

And I have felt pain

And I know now

That I can never be the same



How I wonder why the world can be so cold

And if only good die young

Then left with me cruel here to grow old

And I felt pleasure

And I felt pain

And I know now 

I can never be the same 



And if someday I find my peace of mind

I will share my wealth with all of human kind

I've felt pleasure

And I have felt pain

And I know now

That I can never be the same



So if the sun does shine or rain does fall

I give thanks I've had my sight to see through it all

And I've felt pleasure

And I've felt pain

And I know now

That I can never be the same


Oh no
Here comes that sun again
That means another day
Without you my friend

And it hurts me
To look into the mirror at myself
And it hurts even more
To have to be with somebody else
And it's so hard to do
And so easy to say
But sometimes
Sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away

With so many people
To love in my life
Why do I worry
About one

But you put the happy
In my ness
You put the good times
Into my fun
And it's so hard to do
And so easy to say
But sometimes
Sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away
And head for the door

We've tried the goodbye
So many days
We walk in the same direction
So that we could never stray
They say if you love somebody
Then you have got to set them free
But I would rather be locked to you
Than live in this pain and misery

They say time will
Make all this go away
But it's time that has taken my tomorrows
And turned them into yesterdays
And once again that rising sun
Is droppin' on down
And once again you my friend
Are nowhere to be found
And it's so hard to do
And so easy to say
But sometimes
Sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away
And head for the door
You just walk away
Walk away


Exactly how much will have to burn

Before we will look to the past to learn

We walk along this endless path

Which has led us in a circle 

So here we are right back

We can't let the future become our past

If we are to change the world

Won't you tell me 

Tell me please

How many miles must we march

How many miles must we march



When I was a baby I was not prejudiced

Hey how about you

This was something 

That I learned in school

Something they taught us to do

We can't let our future become our past

If we are to change the world

Won't you tell me 

Tell me please

How many miles must we march

How many miles must we march



There must come a day

When a box is not somebody's home

The unfinished work of our heroes

Must truly be our own

We can't let the future become our past

If we are to change the world

Won't you tell me

Tell me please

How many miles must we march

How many miles must we march

How many miles must we march

How many miles must we march

How many miles must we march

How many miles must we march


>> bethhart

What's that you say 
Gonna sleep all day 
So tired, been wired 
You're so uptight 
Got no sleep last night 
Gone crazy, so lazy 

You say, I've been awake so long 
My feet are 'bout to fumble 
I've been wake so long barely holding on 
I've been wake so long my knees begin to tremble 
And I like how I feel 

Don't turn out the light 
Don't turn out the light 

What's that you said 
Spiders in your bed 
Can't rest here 
Desperate fear 
Go get your gun 
Smoke the little ones 
A cheap thrill, sleeping pill 

You say, I've been wake so long 
My feet are bout to fumble 
I've been wake so long barely holding on 
I've been wake so long my knees begin to tremble 
And I like how I feel 

Spiders in my bed 
Spiders in my bed 
Yes, that's what I said 
Spiders in my bed 
Don't turn out the light


So you think I'm crazy 
Want to take me away 
Inject me with electric shock 
I'm not going nowhere 
Hear what I say loud and clear 
Reveal your sly intentions 
And free my isolation 

A second longer say it's alright 
A second longer say it's alright 
A second longer I'll be insane 
The second I become you 
And what you say 

Run your wires through me 
Fry electricity 
Gas me till I pass on out 
You will not control me 
With your failed philosophies 
Weep to ease the tension 
And free my isolation 

A second longer say it's alright 
A second longer say it's alright 
A second longer I'll be insane 
The second I become you 
And what you say 

Lost my mind today 
It was my desire 
I told them what was wrong but they 
Called me a liar 
Yeah, they called me a liar 
I am not afraid 
Why should I care what they say 
I told them they were wrong still 
They called me a liar 
So I set 'em on fire 

A second longer say it's alright 
What your gonna say


If I whisper my thoughts, would you hear the chanting of my heart?
Phrasing melodies unsung in the dark. 
Saying hold me through the night.
Hear the music from my room, calling out to you.
Come home to me soon. 
Shadows bellowing duets with the moon, singing hold me through the night.
hold me through the night, hold me through the night.

And the water drop in the drain, just like the sound it makes You're coming round again.
There's a soft piano in a warm summer's rain playing hold me through the night,
hold me through the night, hold me through the night.
Hold me, hold me through the night.
Oh ya gotta hold me through.
Ya gotta hold me through the night, hold me through the night.


I can't tell between the two 
It's all the same to me 
I can't tell what's on your mind 
Too late, too far behind 
Life's a state of mind 

Gimme gimme time 
Gimme gimme time 

As I lie beneath the sky 
I speak to fireflies 
And with every passing fear 
My sorrow disappears 
Colors in my tears 
Change thought out the years 

Oh gimme time 
Gimme gimme time 
Oh gimme time 

La la la yi la 
No lesson 
No lesson here 

As I lie beneath the sky 
I speak to fireflies 
And with every passing fear 
My sorrow disappears 
Colors in my tears 
Slowly disappears 

Gimme gimme time 
Oh give me time 
Oh give me time 
Gimme gimme time

Tryin' to fly mountain high
Are you tryin' to be immortal
Come on here's your chance
Take your dance
Say goodbye to your mother
Just let your life shine now's the
Time what you've been given will
Do just fine
Just let your love come through
Your song for the people
Listen to the voices of your soul
Are you trying to be immortal
I can see the future's been painted
Red white and blue
I won't whisper if you won't 
You and I know that it ain't true
Just let your life shine now's the 
Time what you've been given will
Do just fine
Just let your love come through
Your song for the people
Listen to the voices of your soul
They're tryin' to tell you
What you already know
Are you trying to be immortal
My life's a bitch while you're livin' on the bubble
Thought I saw right
But now I think I'm seein' double
Are you tryin' to be immortal
Free the free you got to
Look through your left eye
What you gonna do
What you gonna do
The future's been painted
Red, white and blue


Summer's gone - 
Days passing by again
Chill rushes in sin
Come take me away my friend
I don't wanna take too long
Grab my summer smile and I'll be along


'Cause we're gonna
Ride, ride, ride
Through the valley
Roll, roll, roll
In the fields, I swear
Fly, fly, fly
With the deepest part of our hearts

Are you ready to start
Let's get the hell outta here
Hell on outta here

And if I get lonely
If I get thirsty for the sun
I'll roll down my window
I can feel the road, she's my only one
I ain't gonna waste my time, no way
Get me outta here and I'll bring the wine



Summer's gone - 
Days passing by again...


Rollin' out of bed a little heavy
Sickened from the deadness in my head
Beggin' for a break I'm tired of trippin'
Sounds loud enough to wake the dead

Hear 'em ringing on ringing ringing on
As if it's not enough
From the dusk till dawn
They keep ringing on

Stumble to the mr. coffee maker
Sip a little joe and lift me off
Shakin' from the screams of hurry hurry
Smackin' on the prime I'm way behind

Feel me ringing on yes I'm tingling on
As if it's not enough
Sift the dusk till dawn and I'll be
Ringing on

Rollin' into bed a little heavy
Bounded by the sound that blows my mind
Sister cryin' bleeding worry worries
Mother mary god she sends her sign

Hear her ringing on yes she's singing on
I'll give her all my love
All are dreaming on in her black rust song
Ringing ringing on ringing ringing on

All are dreaming on
In her black rust song


I love you and all that you do
I need you to see me through
I want you and I say
Oh and god bless you

She told me you're going away
I said how can I make you stay
I love you and I say
Oh and god bless you

If I call out your name
Could you hear me calling
If I said that it's wrong
Would you say I'm falling
If I told you the truth would you
Stay
Say ya say ya

I love you and all that you do
I need you to see me through
I want you and I say
Oh and god bless you

I could wait a lifetime to see
The sunrise but I would never
Wait so long to see you all right
And make you knay won't you just
Stay
Say ya say ya


I sing these words
Time and time again
To express my life
Of being your lover and your friend
And as the clouds high above shed their tears
I'll embrace you
With love from all your fears

Am I the one?
Am I the one that you love?
Am I the one?
Am I the one that you think of?
Am I, am I the one?

A passion in your caress
Flows from your fingertips
I pray for the day
I hear those precious words
Pass through your lips
Wishing upon a star from up above
That soon you'll look at me and say
I'm the one that you love

Am I the one?
Am I the one that you love?
Am I the one?
Am I the one that you think of?
Am I, am I the one?

Don't make me feel crazy
If I break down and cry
Just tell me you love me baby
Even if it is a lie

Am I, am I, am I, am I the one?
Am I the one?

I know there's a painful chance I must take
So sadly I ask you afraid it's a mistake
Am I the one?


>> better

How can you be so warm?

How can you know what I feel?

Well, it's the way you move your hands,

and it's the way you understand.





And that's the reason that I'm asking.

That's the reason that I want to know.

And that's the reason that I'm asking,

and that's the reason that I'm...



How can you throw everything you live for?

Well, it's the way we shake and sway.

Oh, and it's the passion that you play.





And that's the reason that I'm asking.

That's the reason that I want to know.

And that's the reason that I'm asking,

and that's the reason that I'm...





Too many lost.

Links in a chain passed down through the years,

But ending here, if we just face the pain and the fear.



Who did you love before?

Who did they love before you?

But it's the way you move your hands

And it's the way you understand.





And that's the reason that I'm asking.

That's the reason that I want to know.

And that's the reason that I'm asking,

and that's the reason that I'm...


Looking around the house.

Hidden behind the window and the door.

Searching for signs of life but there's nobody home.



Well, maybe I'm just too sure.

Maybe I'm just too frightened 

by the sound of it.

Pieces of note fall down, but the letter said, 





Aha, it was good living with you. 

Aha, it was good.

Aha, it was good living with you.

Aha, it was good.



Sitting around the house, 

watching the sun trace shadows on the floor.

Searching for signs of life, but there's nobody home.



Well, maybe I'll call 

or write you a letter.

Now, maybe we'll see on the Fourth of July.

But I'm not too sure, and I'm not too proud.

Well, I'm not too sure and I'm not too proud to say.





Aha, it was good living with you. 

Aha, it was good.

Aha, it was good living with you.

Aha, it was good.



 

Yeah, you were so good.yeah you were so good, yeah that's right...


There she is.

White light,

descending like the color of rain.

July or fall, 

one thing will never change.

Down and out,

you found this city has you on your back.

You long for her to take you away.

And I...





I want a Southern Girl, I need a Southern Girl.

Well, I want a Southern Girl.

Hey, yes, I want a Southern Girl and I need a Southern Girl.

And I want a Southern Girl.



Scent of pine drifting by.

Her hand traces lazy on your neck.

Sunlight through the trees

recalls a better time.

Kids and dogs running by,

She smiles as she drinks ice tea,

Retire to the room, it's easy to see.





I want a Southern Girl, I need a Southern Girl.

Well, I want a Southern Girl.

Hey, yes, I want a Southern Girl and I need a Southern Girl.

And I want a Southern Girl.



Take back the night, claim your desire.

Run 'til you crawl.

In the morning you will find her there.





I want a Southern Girl, I need a Southern Girl.

Well, I want a Southern Girl.

Hey, yes, I want a Southern Girl and I need a Southern Girl.

And I want a Southern Girl.



I want a Southern Girl


Well, she believes that I'd be better off without her.

And she believes in me.



Well, she believes that time can make things right.

And I want to believe that there's been a change in me.





And I hope that she believes.

Yes, I wonder if she sees the killer inside me.



The lights go down

And the clouds are building outside.

You close the door and turn the key,

But there's no place to hide.





And I hope that she believes.

Yes, I wonder if she sees the killer inside me.



The killer inside me.

The killer inside me.

The killer inside...


Where have you gone, my Rosealia?

Into the crowd, he'll never find you.

If you walk real fast, and you stay down low.

So many times, so many chances, this one could be your last.





You say no, no, no, the fighting has left you tired.

You say no, no, no, but the fighting goes on.

Put on your mask, wearing your cape.

Put on your mask, my Rosealia.

Put on your mask, wearing your cape.

Put on your mask, my Rosealia.



What has he done, my senorita?

His kind of love is going to kill you.

Do you fake a smile when you dodge the blows?

So many times, so many chances.

This one could be your last.





You say no, no, no, the fighting has left you tired.

You say no, no, no, but the fighting goes on.

Put on your mask, wearing your cape.

Put on your mask, my Rosealia.

Put on your mask, wearing your cape.

Put on your mask, my Rosealia.





Jealousy can rip your heart out.

And jealousy can turn a hand into a fist.





You say no, no, no, the fighting has left you tired.

You say no, no, no, but the fighting goes on.

Put on your mask, wearing your cape.

Put on your mask, my Rosealia.

Put on your mask, wearing your cape.

Put on your mask, my Rosealia.



Rosealia...


You cleaned out your room and under your bed, 

lay a picture long forgotten.

With a hand to your head, 

you sigh out loud as your memory rushes over and

buries you.



A summer rain storm,

but the shed was dry

with a girl from Carolina.

And you held her so tight,

for the warmth that the rain denied,

as the timer slowed to a flash.

So alive, you listen to them when they say...





Cry in the sun. 

When the devil beats his wife.

If you cry, cry, cry in the sun...

Hope I never see the price of my freedom.



We'd dance and sing out,

and trace the moon,

as it crawled across the night sky.

And covered in dew, a lover's pact:

Well, here's to now and don't look back.

And oh, how I tried to heed the words written here.





Cry in the sun. 

When the devil beats his wife.

If you cry, cry, cry in the sun...

Hope I never see the price of my freedom.





For every one yeah

There's a person, place or time,

that brings you back and makes you feel alive.

Before your reason clouds your eyes, 

When you could rule the world if you wanted to...

yeah.



Well, I hear you're living far away.

And that life's treated you well.

You know that we were young,

And this picture's old.

But I still can hear you say,

Through the pounding of the rain.

And oh, if you try,

Tell me, can you hear them say...







Cry in the sun. 

When the devil beats his wife.

If you cry, cry, cry in the sun...

Hope I never see the price of my freedom.


Listen to them fight.

Hear your mother cry.

Weekend at your dad's.

They don't know what they do to you.

Teenager. Teenager...



Wrap yourself in black.

Listen to the Cure.

Love line won't call back.

They don't know,

they don't care,

they don't see,

but I do.





And if it feels good do it.

And if it tastes fine drink.

Well, there's a range of possibilities to find.

Teenager. Teenager...



No one knows your name.

No one hears your cry.

Fall in with the fringe

because they know what you're going through.

They do.





And if it feels good do it.

And if it tastes fine drink.

Well, there's a range of possibilities to find.

Teenager. Teenager...





No one's wrong,

no one's right.

It comes down on you.

And I have found, your life inside mine.



Hear your mother cry

Fade into the night.

When they ask you why,

They won't know, they won't feel,

They won't see,

But you will.





And if it feels good do it.

And if it tastes fine drink.

Well, there's a range of possibilities to find.

Teenager. Teenager...


Down by the dock, hot blood in the sun.

The body lays up against the reeds.

The locals said, the man had it coming,

and it's time someone put him six feet in the ground.





Where did she go that night?

Where did she sleep when the morning came

to the summer house?



Missus showed up to I.D. the body

Then shed a tear as she hid a smile.

The sergeant laughed and smiled in frustration.

One life is lost while another one is found.





Where did she go that night?

Where did she sleep when the morning came

to the summer house?


Hey, you've got a lot of nerve to show your face around here.

Hey, you've got a lot of nerve to dredge up all my fears.

Well, I wish I could shake some sense into you and walk out the door.





But your skin is like porcelain.

Yeah, your skin is like porcelain.



Just the other day I felt I had you by a string.

Just the other day I felt we could be everything.

But now when I see you, you're somebody else.

In somebody's eyes and your skin...





But your skin is like porcelain.

Yeah, your skin is like porcelain.





I don't know what I'm saying.

Well, I don't know if you're there.

In the words you are feigning.

Do you even care?



Well I wish I could kill you, 

savor the sight.

Get in to my car, drive into the night.

Then lie as I scream to the heavens above.

That I was the last one you ever loved. 

Yes, your skin is like porcelain.





But your skin is like porcelain.

Yeah, your skin is like porcelain.


Will you fight for the cause?

Can you teach the savage mind, their ways are wrong, 

Help them see what they want and what they need?

And if we have to twist their arms,

They know not what they do is wrong.





And if you said I would go to heaven 

Now, maybe I'll try.

And if you said I would go to heaven

Now, maybe I'll try.



Heretics and hypocrites,

Wear the same face through the years.

Telling lies and laying blame.

Damn the fire to feed the flame.

Don't dance or sing or try to think,

They're images planted in your head.





And if you said I would go to heaven 

Now, maybe I'll try.

And if you said I would go to heaven

Now, maybe I'll try.



Ivy is just a dog

With a heart that's noble as

The greatest man who ever lived.

Won't you please help her learn?

And if we have to twist her arms,

She knows not what she does is wrong.





And if you said I would go to heaven 

Now, maybe I'll try.

And if you said I would go to heaven

Now, maybe I'll try.



And if you said I'll be a rich man...


>> blackcrowes

Clean as a whistle

Smellin' like a rose

She got no dirty little fingers

Bloodshot eyes are gone



Tell me I'm wrong



Twice as Hard

As it was the first time

I said goodbye



And no one ever wanna' know

Love ain't funny

A crime in the wink of an eye



Your sister always singing

She play the step child

A broken little memory

Her heart was never kind



Tell me I'm blind







Yeah, bloodshot eyes are gone

Tell me I'm wrong






Cheat the odds that made you

Brave to try to gamble at times

Well I feel like dirty laundry

Sending sickness on down the line

Tell you why



'Cause I'm jealous, jealous again

Thought it time I let you in

Yeah, I'm jealous, jealous again

Got no time, baby



Always drunk on Sunday

Try'n to feel like I'm at home

Smell the gasoline burning

Boys out feeling nervous and cold







Stop, understand me

I ain't afraid of losing face

Stop, understand me

I ain't afraid of ever losing faith in you



Never felt like smiling

Sugar wanna' kill me yet

Find me loose lipped and laughing

Singing songs ain't got no regrets







Don't you think I want to

Don't you think I would

Don't you think I'd tell you baby

If I only could

Am I acting crazy

Am I just too proud

Am I just plain lazy

Am I, Am I, Am I, ever






Worried sick my eyes are hurting

To rest my head I'd take a life

Outside the girls are dancing

'Cause when you're down it just don't seem right



Feeling second fiddle to a dead man

Up to my neck with your disregard

Like a beat dog that's walking on the broadway

No one wants to hear you when you're down



Sister luck is screaming out

Somebody else's name

Sister luck is screaming out

Somebody else's name



A flip of a coin

Might make a head turn

No surprise, who sleeps

Held my hand over a candle

Flame burnin' but I never weep



Sister luck is screaming out

Somebody else's name

Sister luck is screaming out

Somebody else's name



What a shame






How could I've been so blind

So empty that I've never felt warm

Can I spell it out

Turn myself out of my home

Lookin' like a fool

Feelin' even worse than it seems

Tryin' hard as nails

Believin' only in myself



And now it looks like innocence is gone

I know right and I know what's wrong

Feeling lonely that's the way it goes

Sometimes



But my greatest fear

Paint a smile from ear to ear

Alone and cryin'

Living like this is no better than dying



I tell you baby things are gonna' change

Looking like we were caught out in the rain

Feeling lonely

That's the way it goes

Sometimes







Could I ever have been so blind

Could I ever have been so blind

Could I ever have been so blind

Could I ever have been so blind



Solo

Could I ever have been so blind

Could I ever have been so blind



Hardest thing I ever had to do

Was stand up straight and tell it all to you

Look you right in the eye

Tell you baby sorry but I have lied



And now it looks like innocence is gone

I know right and I know what's wrong

Feeling lonely that's the way it goes

Sometimes






I find it hard to shed a tear

You brought it all on yourself my dear

Wrong, yes I may be

Don't leave a light on for me

'Cause I ain't comin' home

It hurts me baby to be alone

Yes, it hurts me baby



A hundred years will never ease

Hearing things I won't believe

I saw it with my own two eyes

All the pain that I can't hide

And this pain starts in my heart

And this love tears us apart

You won't find me bent down on my knees

Ain't bendin' over backwards baby

Not to please



'Cause I'm seeing things for the first time

I'm seeing things for the first time, oh yeah

I'm seeing things for the first time

In my life, in my life



I used to dream

Of better days that never came

Sorry ain't nothin' to me

I'm gone and that's the way it must be

So please I've done my time

Lovin' you is such a crime

You won't fine me down on, on my knees

Won't fine me over backwards baby

Just to please



'Cause I'm seeing things for the first time

I"m seeing things for the first time

Seeing things for the first time

Oh I'm seeing things for the first time

Yeah, seeing things for the first time

I'm seeing things for the first time

Yeah, I'm seeing things for the first time

In my life, in my life


Baby, here I am
I'm the man on the scene
I can give you what you want
But you gotta come home with me
I have got some good old lovin'
And I got some more in store
When I get to throwin' it on you
You gotta come back for more


Boys are things that come by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Hey little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now
Yes, I am

Action speaks louder than words
And I'm a man of great experience
I know you've got another man
But I can love you better than him

Take my hand don't be afraid
I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free
So you can place your ad with me


Boys – they come along a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothing but ten cent lovin'
Hey little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now
Yes, I am

Yeah
Hard to handle now
Oh baby




Boys – they run along a dime by the dozen

Hey little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now

Boys – they go along a dime by the dozen

Haa, yeah


Got a chainsaw buzzin'

Who's that cussin'

Eyes start blinkin'

The boys all start their wishing



Left holdin' the bag again

Buring it at both ends

Don't believe she's a friend







Thick, thick & thin

Let it loose now, let it go to the wind



Got my clock tock tickin'

Hear the madame start bitchin'

See the boys itch itchin'

Do girls ever know what they're missin'



But it sounds like shit to me

Last laugh mine will be

I don't believe she is clean







Thick, baby, yeah, thick & thin


Hey boys, buzzin' bee stingin'

Ringing ears never gonna' stop

Stand tall sickness creeping right on

Struttin' blues gonna' find me again



Got my head spinnin' round

Wonderin' when it's gonna stop

Got my head spinnin' round

Wonderin' when it's gonna stop



Out there, breeze is finally blowing

No tellin' when the train pulls in

My baby got her engine hummin'

Struttin' blues gonna' find me again







Hey boys, hanging on the corner

Where you hidin' when the lights go dim

This thing lightin' got your thunder want to crack'n

Struttin' blues want to find me again






Under the weather

I never got better

Wrapped up in my disease

Mile away, she want to count my day

Look a little older in the light



Under the weather

Feelin' very heavy

Never up for no air



Sea legs start to wigglin'

And sick I'm still feelin'

Just know I never cared



Don't you want to feel it

Don't you want to stare it cold



Don't you want to feel it

Don't you want to stare it cold



Never thought about it

And never no questions

Seein' where I've gone wrong



No kiss made it magic

'Cause that old girl has had it

Then it's time for me to run along














"Get Chris in here. Hey Chris! Have you got a minute? What?"

Gonna stop on the dot

Got hte ground all shaking

The wink of and eye

See the noose still swinging

Feeling tounge tied

And I'll nver sop falling

Waste of my time

And the girls start stalling

Don't wake me up

don't wake me

Sleep walking dry

Got everybody saking

Make it all right

See the old man coming

The cat in the bag

She gonna start scratching

Jakc-kife's fine

The blood mean's nothin' but

Don't wake me up

Don't' wake me

Don't wake me up

Don't wake me

Solo

Somebody ain't running

Somebody ain't walking

?? talking

??

Gun-filing code (?!)

And the teeth start scraping

The grave ?? doves

And nobody laughing

Live that life

Rolling in the backroom

Thorn stuck in my side

Someone come and took off (?)

Don't wake me up

Don't wake me

Don't wake me up

Don't wake me

Weeds blow tall on a broken train track

Ruth B. draws we're fixin' to get high

Maybe we'll hit the bluffs and find ourselves the same old rum 



But everybody says this place is beautiful

And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye

But everything's the same this town is pitiful

And I'll be gettin' out as soon as I can fly 



Life goes by on a Talihina sky 



The hopped up boys are lookin' for their trouble

The knocked up girls, well they've all got their share

Ruth seems out of her mind, swears she won't give in this time


You know you could've been a wonder

Takin' your circus to the sky

You couldn't take it on the tight rope

No you had to take it on the side

You always like it undercover

Tucked in between your dirty sheets

But no one's even done nuttin' to ya

In between the hollers and the screams



And I said nah nah hey hey

Another dirty bird ain't givin' out a taste

In the black of the night till the red morning light



You got your cozy little corner

All night you're jammin' on your feet

Hangin' out just like a street sign

And put a twenty dollar trick

I hear you're blowin' like a feather

And then they rub it in your face

Oh once they've had all their fun hun

You're at the bottom of the cage 



And I said nah nah hey hey

Another dirty bird ain't giving out a taste

In the black of the night till the red morning light

And I said nah nah hey hey you're givin' all your cinnamon away

That's not right 







Hey hey another dirty bird ain't givin' out a taste

Uh hey keep on givin' away and givin' it away (givin' it away)

Hey hey you're givin' all your cinnamon away

Hey hey you're givin' all your cinnamon away


On our way, so it seems, blooming flowers waltz before me

Rollin' numbers, passing time, got to get outside the city,

In the morning all will see, just how crazy young love can be

On our own away again, don't get down my darlin'



I'm gonna tangle my face hair, it's gonna tickle your daughter

3 o'clock and the moaning, they all cry to me,

I'll be prancin' around in my high heels, and your cherry red lipstick,

Look out your window i'm on your street



Miles away, so unclear, almost lost it in Montana

Lets pull over, have us a choke

I love to watch you when your dancin'

I wonder if they ever dream, they would get just what we gave them

All wrapped up in 19, chasin' stars that are fallin' 







When that train heads home,

They're gonna be so gone gone, you aint never gonna see me

Im a gone gone, you aint nothin to me

When they shine them streets, they're gonna find our song







I'm on your street , they all cry to me


It's your life

Don't you let em tell you when to bat your eyes

You're the only one who's gonna sacrifice

Makes no difference if you're right or wrong

Take that ride

But I want your little sister by your side

Maybe little later we can all collide

Do our livin' like a rollin' stone

Time on me is wasted time

Time on me is wasted time

Time on me is wasted time

Time on me is wasted 





Innocent smile

Runnin' free

Baby's gonna give it like it used to be



Show your face

Livin' in the shadows like you got no name

Enough to make a little girly go insane

Be my guest to let it out tonight

It's ok

I know all about the little games you play

Shakin' your apple right in my face

Only when you know that I'm beggin' fort a bite

Time on me is wasted time

Time on me is wasted time

Time on me is wasted time

Time on me is wasted 







So won't you show your face (show your face)

Your little apple shake (show your face)

I know the love you gave (show your face)

I know the love you take (show your face)





Time on me is wasted time

Time on me is wasted time

Time on me is wasted time

Time on me is wasted


Blistered cracked and bleeding

Cold no one should know

Rain falls down a freezing

And sticking like a snow

Lingering suspicions

Screaming in my head

Lies all mixed up with omissions

Aw welcome home again

It's too late for apologies they're falling at my feet



This is just the way of the world Joe said

I had to put a bullet into his head

Then lit up a cigarette

Decided to call his fat friend Fred

Well he said Fred I just killed a man

Caught him laying with my girlfriend

Now they're both dead, people can be so cold when they're dead



Calling all the neighbors

Time to make amends

Whiskey floods the table

Aw good friends 'til the end

They're making silly faces and it's tasting bitter sweet

Dirty belly of a secret town

Cheap trick hookers that are hanging out at the bar in the Greyhound station

And the bare-chested boys are going down on every thing that the momma believes

Pack of smokes and a little bump of cocaine, help you feel not so strange





Said old Pa, "She don't get off, unless somebody standing near her."

"And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line, cause all tied to the chair."

I said, "Lay it now on the ground, throw in a white noise sound, like a tranny on a ten."



All the bubbas got their heads in a nod, 

they don't know what they love or deserve to get

Chances are they tab their worm in a slab, 

doesn't even know which fish that he like to bite tonight, ah tonight, tonight, tonight





Ah maybe tonight

Said old Pa, "She don't get off, unless somebody standing near her."

"And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line, hands all tied to the chair." 

I said, "Lay it now on the ground, throw in a white noise sound, like a tranny on a ten."

Comes home on call, isn't that peace, 

fingers in the dirt, and he's spitting out his teeth

He's spitting out his teeth



I said, "Lay it on the ground, throw in a white noise sound, like a tranny on a ten." 


Little Mona Lisa laying by my side

"Crimson and Clover" pullin' overtime

Seem too close to be losin' touch

By givin' in, what am I givin' up

Am I losin' way too much



Hey 

California waiting

Every little thing's gotta be just right

Say

While you're tryin' to save me

Can't I get back my lonely life



I'm goin' so fast that I can't slow down

It's hard to get up when you're spinnin' round and round

I'd tell you the news but nothin's changed

I'd sing you a song but they blew it away

All wrapped up in this stupid ass game



Hey 

California waiting

Every little thing's gotta be just right

Say

While you're tryin' to save me

Can't I get back my lonely life

Can't I get back my lonely life


Spiral Staircase goin' down,

Paint your body red and brown,

On our knees, we'll feast on tha sex show.

Spiral Staircase! Spiral Staircase!

Greasy haircuts, a German Chinese girl,

A they all came to party, and there's four to every stall,

It gets frus-ta-ratin', a just a pissin' on this wall,

Seems like there's another story bangin',

Around every step you fake.

Free- is all that she could bleed

That's why'll she'll never stay

White- bare naked in the night

Just lookin' for some play

Just another girl that wants to rule the world

Any time or place

And when she gets into your head

You know she's there to stay



You want it

She's got it

Molly's Chambers gonna change your mind

She's got your

Your pistol



Slow- She's burnin' in your soul

With whispers in your ear

It's okay I'll give it anyway

Just get me out of here

You'll plead- you'll get down on your knees

For just another taste

And when you think she's let you in

That's when she fades away



You want it

She's got it

Molly's Chambers gonna change your mind

She's got your

Your pistol


Everybody wants to be a showman

Yeah they all got another one

Everybody thinks they got a genius

Everybody got me on the run

Sometimes I think they come here

Just so you can say that you can

And I can't get alone in my bathroom

I need to give myself a hand 



Ya'll cuh-cuh-cuh-creepin'

Creepin' underneath my skin

Fuck you and your flashbulbs

Snappin' my picture again

You drank all my whiskey

You stole all my smoke

And you're crowded all around me

Like I got nowhere to go 



Eyes are gonna roll back

I'm here to kill

Time for you to go

I'm-a-gon' spill

It ain't yo fast train

I'll be the king runnin' near the wheel

I ain't lookin' to make no deals here no 



You keep stickin' to me like a prickly porcupine

You're gettin' your information from the grocery checkout line

Are you through confessin' of your little girl obsession

'Cause I was only messin' and I had a little time

How would I know it was a scheme 
To get me to you

Through my heart

I build this garden for us, I build this garden for us 
I build this garden for us, I build this garden for us 

In this garden 
This lovely garden 
I build a temple of love 
Walk with the Father 
Won't be a bother 
To touch the Earth as it was 
We'll farm the land each day 
And in the sunshine we will play 
Glory glory for the day He came 
Our tears had gone away 
We'll make love in the shade 
And in the ocean we will bathe 
Little fishies in the sea 
Say hooray 

I build this garden for us, I build this garden for us 
I build this garden for us, I build this garden for us 

In this garden 
Our children will grow 
Darling this is a must 
We'll be so happy 
Our little family 
So full of love and trust 
And darling when we're old 
We'll close the gates and lock the door 
Our love will never fade away 
When it's pure it forever last 
And darling when you're cold 
I'll hold you tight and keep you warm 
Little darlin' gonna make it through the storm 
You'll never be alone 

I build this garden for us, I build this garden for us

In this garden 
They'll be no war 
No racial prejudice 
You'll be my brother 
Of any color 
You'll just be okay with us 
We'll live each day in peace 
In hope that we will one day reach 
The rest of the world 
When they are ready to be teached 
The kingdom will come 
Thy will will be done 
On Earth as it is in heaven

I smell the fear that rains inside 
The thought of children who must oblige 
To tainted dreams and polluted seas 
The missing moon and melting trees 
A mist of doom and clouds of pain 
A toxic waste and an acid rain 
The passing of our ignorance 
A lifetime spent in abstinence 

I living in fear, I living in fear 
I can't tell you no lies 
I living in fear, I living in fear 

Conditioned to hate and them to blame 
Their search for God is just the same 
Machines for hearts, how warped a view 
Forgeting that they're human too 
Waiting like a branded steer 
Who first will launch the burning spear 
When every day may be your last 
You think we'd learn from our past 

I living in fear, I living in fear 
I can't tell you no lies 
I living in fear, I living in fear 
Ouh yeah yeah yeah yeah 

I smell the fear that rains inside 
The thought of so many lives denied 
More wounded soldiers, another burning flag 
And rows and rows of body bags 
No time for tears as the night falls cold 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
The day survivors crawl back in their holes 
As for the rest they're shipped back home 
Home to the rows of white tomb stones 

I living in fear, I living in fear 
I can't tell you no, tell you no lies, yeah yeah 
Fear, I living in fear 
Ouh yeah yeah yeah yeah


The dream is lost 
Don't let it slip away 
Or bloody days won't be far away 
'Cause when there's no more sun 
There's no where you can run 

Does anybody know how many lives we've lost 
Can anybody ever pay the cost 
What will it take for us to join in peace my friends 
Does anybody out there even care 

Wake up world before it's too late 
It's time for love to conquer hate 
And when the battle's won 
We all can live as one 

Does anybody know how many lives we've lost 
Can anybody ever pay the cost 
What will it take for us to join in peace my friends 
Does anybody out there even care 

Hey 
Riots in the streets, 
Men dressed in white sheets 
Is that what we want 
Oh a little boy hanging from a tree 
And a burning cross 
If we can learn that we're one we can overcome 
Before this takes us all 
We'd better catch ourselves before we fall 

Does anybody know how many lives we've lost 
Yeah hey hey hey 
Can anybody ever pay the cost 
What will it take for us to join in peace my friends 
Does anybody out there even care 
Does anybody out there even care

Little Mary was five years old 
Her parents left her, she was out in the cold 
Alone to live and find her way 
In this great world of heartache and pain 

Eyes of brown, matted locks of gold 
Her flowered dress is tattered and soiled 
Tear stained cheeks, her feet cold and bare 
Who could have left a child so rare 

Rosemary your day will come 
He loved you so He gave His only son 
Keep the faith in your soul 
Stay down on your knees 
I'm begging you please 
Hold onto the beads at your heart 

A burning heart and tired eyes 
Howling winds for lullabys 
No one there to soothe her fright 
Nowhere to turn but the inward light 
Because life is for believing 
That your heart can turn to gold 
All you need is Christ to receive it 
There's eternal life for every soul 

Rosemary your day will come 
He loved you so He gave His only son 
Keep the faith in your soul 
Stay down on your knees 
I'm begging you please 
Hold onto the beads at your heart 

Rosemary, Rosemary 
He loves you 
He needs you 
He wants you 
So don't let him down 

Singing 
Rosemary your day will come 
He loved you so He gave His only son 
Keep the faith in your soul 
Stay down on your knees 
I'm begging you please 
Hold onto the beads at your heart 

Yeah yeah, 
Rosemary, singing, Rosemary 
Rosemary 
Rosemary, come on now yeah 
Got to keep the faith yeah 
Keep the faith


Lord what's the matter 
Am I lost 
This life's a disaster, what is the cause 
Am I a junkie, what is my fate 
Or am I a flunkie who doesn't relate 
Or am I a child so full of hate 

Am I a doctor or even a priest 
Or am I a rapist who needs a release 
A psychotic prancer 
Times Square dancer 
The mind can see as long as you'll be 
For real with yourself 
And you'll forever be 

Be, be, be, be 
You'll forever be 
Be, be, be, you'll forever you be 
You'll forever be 
When you're real with yourself 
You'll forever be 

Lord what's the matter am I insame 
This life's an illusion that's all it remains 
Are you listening, are you boss 
Am I gonna make it up on that cross 
Believe in Your name and 
You'll forever be 

Be, be, be, be 
You'll forever be 
Be, be, be, you'll forever be 
Ever be, ever be 
You'll forever be 
You'll forever, ever, ever.

I wonder what it's like to be the rainmaker 

I wonder what it's like to know that I make the rain 

I'd store it in boxes with little yellow tags on everyone 

And you can come see them when I'm...done, when I'm 

Done 

I wonder what it's like to be a super hero 

I wonder where I'd go if I could fly around downtown 

From some other planet, I get this funky high on yellow 

Sun 

Boy I bet my friends will all be...stunned, they're stunned 





Straight up, what did you hope to learn about here 

If I were someone else, would this all fall apart 

Strange, where were you, when we started this gig, 

I wish the real world, would just stop hassling me 



I wonder what it's like to be the head honcho 

I wonder what I'd do if they all did just what I said 

I'd shout out an order, I think we're out of this man get 

me some 

Boy don't make me wanna change my...tone, my tone 







Please don't change, please don't break 

The only thing that seems to work at all is you 

Please don't change, at all from me 

To you, and you to me 






It's sitting by the overcoat, 

The second shelf, the note she wrote 

That I can't bring myself to throw away 

And also 

Reach she said for no one else but you, 

Cuz you won't turn away 

When someone else is gone 



I'm sorry 'bout the attitude 

I need to give when I'm with you 

But no one else would take this shit from me 

And I'm so 

Terrified of no one else but me 

I'm here all the time 

I won't go away 

It's me, yeah I can't get myself to go away 

It's me, and I can't get myself to go away 

Oh God I shouldn't feel this way 







Reach down your hand in your pocket 

Pull out some hope for me 

It's been a long day, always ain't that right 

And no Lord your hand won't stop it 

Just keep you trembling 

It's been a long day, always ain't that right 



Well I'm surprised that you'd believe 

In any thing that comes from me 

I didn't hear from you or from someone else 

And you're so 

Set in life man, a pisser they're waiting 

Too damn bad you get so far so fast 

So what, so long 







It's me, yeah and I can't get myself to go away 

It's me, yeah and I can't get myself to go away 

Oh God I shouldn't feel this way 






She said it's cold outside and she hands me my raincoat
She's always worried about things like that
She said it's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault
And she only sleeps when it's raining
And she screams and her voice is strained
And


She says baby
It's 3 am I must be lonely
When she says baby
Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
The rain's gonna wash away I believe it

She's got a little bit of something, God it's better than nothing
And in her color portrait world she believes that she's got it all
She swears the moon don't hang quite as high as it used to
And she only sleeps when it's raining
And she screams and her voice is strained...
And


She says baby
It's 3 am I must be lonely
Well heaven she says baby
Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
Says the rain's gonna wash away I believe it

She believes that life is made up of all that you're used to
And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days, and days
She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway
But outside it's stopped raining


She says baby
It's 3 am I must be lonely
Well heaven she says baby
Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
Says the rain's gonna wash away I believe it

Well it's 3 am I must be lonely
Well heaven she says baby
Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes


She said I don't know if I've ever been good enough

I'm a little bit rusty, and I think my head is caving in

And I don't know if I've ever been really loved

By a hand that's touched me, well I feel like something's

Gonna give

And I'm a little bit angry, well



This ain't over, no not here, not while I still need you

Around

You don't owe me, we might change

Yeah we just might feel good







I wanna push you around, well I will, I will

I wanna push you down, well I will, I will

I wanna take you for granted, I wanna take you for granted

Well I will



She said I don't know why you ever would lie to me

Like I'm a little untrusting when I think that the truth is

Gonna hurt ya

And I don't know why you couldn't just stay with me

You couldn't stand to be near me

When my face don't seem to want to shine

Cuz it's a little bit dirty well



Don't just stand there, say nice things to me

I've been cheated I've been wronged, and you

You don't know me, I can't change

I won't do anything at all







Oh but don't bowl me over

Just wait a minute well it kinda fell apart, things get so

Crazy, crazy

Don't rush this baby, don't rush this baby






You think this life would make me bolder 

But I'm running scared is all 

I hang on everything about you 

You think I'd settle down cuz I'm older 

But I roll with the changes is all 

I'm same old trailer trash in new shoes 



She gets sad when there's nothing going on 

She says it makes her feel damn worthless 







Well you got to think with a girl like that 

Any love at all, is better than nothing 

It's better than nothing 



I put my hands around your shoulder 

You're saying you're scared is all 

I think I know too much about you 

You think this life would make me colder 

I'd give in to the alcohol 

I put my loving arms around you, child 



You knew damn well there was nothing going on 

Is that what makes you feel damn worthless 







Well you got to think with a girl like that 

Any love is better than nothing 

It's better than nothing 

You got to think, with a girl like that 

Any love at all, is better than nothing 

It's better than nothing 

Yeah she drags you down and she pulls you up 

She pulls you up 

Says that she's sorry now but it's not enough 

To pull you up 

She's sorry 



I wake up quick just like I want to 

Yeah but I stay out much too late 

You think this life can get a bit unkind but she stays 

Down till the worth is gone 

And pulls you up, she pulls you up, 

She pulls you up and over, over 










It's nothing, it's so normal you 

Just stand there I could say so much 

But I don't go there cuz I don't want to 

I was thinking if you were lonely 

Maybe we could leave here and no one would know 

At least not to the point that we would think so 



Everyone here, knows everyone here is thinking about 

Somebody else 

It's best if we all keep it under our heads 

I couldn't tell, if anyone here was feeling the way I do 

But I'm lonely now, and I don't know how 

To get it back to good 



This don't mean that, you own me 

This ain't no good, in fact it's phony as hell 

But things worked out just like you wanted too 

If you see me out you don't know me 

Try to turn your head, try to give me some room 

To figure out just what I'm going to do 



And everyone here, hates everyone here for doing just like 

They do 

It's best if we all keep this quiet instead 

And I couldn't tell, why everyone here was doing me like 

They do 

But I'm sorry now, and I don't know how 

To get it back to good 



Everyone here, is wondering what it's like to be with 

Somebody else 

Everyone here's to blame, everyone here 

Gets caught up in the pleasure of the pain, everyone hides 

Shades of shame, but looking inside we're the same, we're 

The same 

And we're all grown now, but we don't know how 

To get it back to good 



Everyone here, knows everyone here is thinking 'bout 

Somebody else 

It's best if we all keep this under our heads 

I couldn't tell, if anyone here was feeling the way I do 

But it's over now, and I don't know how, it's over now 

There's no getting back to good


This old world well 

Don't it make you wanna think damn 

This cold girl well 

Don't she wanna make you scream, damn 



What's the matter girl 

Don't you think I'm good enough 

This old heart's had a whole lot a breakin' down 

She's got all these reasons in her head 





All that time she knew if I lied 

You can bet she will 

She's taking her time 'til I thought I would die 

And I can't sit still 



Things got turned 'round 

Don't know where I started from, damn 

Can't eat, can't sleep 

Could have been a bigger man, damn 

What's the matter girl don't you think I'm bright enough 

This old man had a hard time getting here 

You can leave your number at the door 







And there's nothing at all 

Yeah there's nothing at all 

Well there's nothing at all 

To make her change her mind 



This old house been quiet since 

You went away, damn 

Mixed up fixed out 

Don't forget who got you here, damn 



What's the matter world 

Don't you see I opened up 

This whole part been played by another man 

I pulled out the reason card instead 











Says she can find 

The things that make up a life 

I bet she will 

She stays behind, I could stay here all night 

I could stay here until 



Until there's nothing at all 

Yeah there's nothing at all 

Well there's nothing at all 

To make her change her mind


She don't, but she will 

He says anything to keep her by him 

She takes, what she gets, and she never did flinch 

over, and over, well anyone 

With any mind would think that's all she gets 







If you want you can get to know me well 

We get along so we shouldn't argue 

And I don't know, said I don't know 

All these feelings cloud up my reasoning 

Cloud up my reasoning 



I know, but I still 

Believe in ignorance as my best defense 

So go on, wreck me 

Funny how I carry on, and not be taken over 

Will not roll over on anyone, 

cuz anyone would stand up on my side 







You know it's funny how sometimes, 

It don't work out like you want to 

No you never get nothing at all 

Then she tells you that it's nothing at all 

Then she tells you that it's over, boy don't you hate it 

When it's over 

I guess something just got lost, and it deeply saddens me 

So over, and over anyone, who's anyone 






Kody sat down on the avenue 

He tapped his feet, to the humming of the highway 

He watched the light shine down on the broken glass and thought 

I don't got no reasons, yet 

There it is and there it was 

It was clear to all of us 

We kept this hat of broken dreams 

And we pulled them out, when we needed them around 





So please hand me the bottle, I think I'm lonely now 

And please give me direction, I think the hurt sets in 

And I don't feel nothing 



There's a squeak hinge down on the back gate 

It lets us know if he comes around 

I don't sleep that good anyway 

If you've never heard the silence, it's a God awful sound 





So please hand me the bottle, I think I'm lonely now 

And please give me direction, I think I just caved in

And I don't feel nothing 



I don't feel nothing, no I don't feel nothing 

There's nothing to feel good about here 



Don't much get down to the avenue 

I could drive, but it takes so much to get there 

Don't get off on all the broken glass, the cadillac scene, 

Well 

I've seen a lot of good things die and I'm 

In an over emotional way 





So please hand me the bottle, I think I'm lonely now 

And please give me direction, I think the hurt sets in 

And I don't feel nothing


I forget when words were only words 

She knows the party makes me nervous 

In this stage we can't get hurt 

Don't try to understand me 



We're too cool to be alone 

But, not too crazy to get busted 



I found out one life ain't enough 

I need another soul to feed on 

I'm the flame I can't get burnt 

I'm wholly understated 



I found silence in this space 

An on and off again attraction 

I need such amazing grace 

Heaven sweep me away 







Love don't change, don't come around here 

Don't wear my heart on your sleeve 

Like a high school letter 

Don't strain, cuz nothing ever comes from it 

And the people we've become, well 

They've never been the people who we are 



I strap on one horse and prayed for luck 

I dug another hole to bleed 

I know exactly how this works 

I need a new feel dirty 



I don't need you crowding up my space 

I just want to get inside you 

You can't blame the heart you save 

Giving something awa 







I dreamed that the world was crumbling down 

We sat on my back porch and watched it 

I dreamed that the buildings all fell down 

We sat on my back porch and watched it 

In my head I heard the sound 

Like fifteen strangers dancing 



But oh how I want you to know me 

Oh how I want you to know me 

Oh how I wish I was somebody else, baby 

Oh how I wish you could own me

Ever see the tree, ever feel yourself
Wrapped around the wind
Let go of your desire

Desire will suffer in the send
suffer the will, will of the child
the child will born on our death
Child will be born on our death

Oh let the child be born
and be brought to the sun

As desire will come and suffer the will, will
will of the child 

Everything is so beautiful
Everything is so simple now

Colors weave into symbols of life
symbols of life they weave into the wind
Oh weary child rest your head
Very soon the colors come alive

And the child will be born
born on our death
child will be born on our death

Oh let the child be born
and be brought to the sun
As the symbols of life
weave into the wind 

Because everything is simple now
Nothing has ever changed
The colors all weave with life
Let the weary child be born

Because everything is simple now
Nothing has ever changed
The colors all weave with life
as we move into the wind


Shades of gray coldness from inside
Snowed in without a shovel or plow
Rhetoric on the radio 'Don't you go outside'

I shiver in the dark coldness all around
Hide behind my jacket Listen to the cold facts of lies
Because we will we will burn
We will we will burn for the winter

A man pulls off his glove
to take a look at the time
From beneath the watch
sweat starts to flow

A father cries out into the night
as his child slips away
A door shuts as the boy reaches that forbidden room

And the shades of gray
getting lighter and lighter
and the shades of gray getting lighter and lighter

Because we will we will burn oh
We will we will burn for the winter





Hey Mister can you help me sir I plead for your sympathy
Rains came pounding us down again
Your horizons they crawl up to my chin
I started to drown in your vision
I looked through your windows as they flew through the air
All I could find was a river in pieces

How long should we play the Martyr? 

Hey Mister come down and see see your misery
Rains came pounding us down well again
Through your weakness I shed my skin
Open wide to my spirit
I looked through your windows as they flowed through the air
I was Left swirling in your pool of aggression
How long should we play the martyr?



Hey Mister can you help me sir I plead for your sympathy
Rains came pounding us down again
Your horizons they crawl up to my chin
I started to drown in your vision
I looked through your windows as they flew through the air

What is that you said
Gotta whistle in the wind yea go down go down go down
Fear for me and I will fear for you, fear, fear
Fear whistles in the wind as I go down
Fear whistles in the wind as I blow down

When the cat turned blue

You gotta whistle in the wind and again yea 

Fear for me and I will fear for you 
Fear

Fear whistles in the wind as I go down
Fear whistles in the wind as I blow down

I can't get no relief

When the cat turned blue

Don't walk away Eileen!
I've been living for you since the age of seventeen
Don't walk away Eileen!
You've been telling lies and now it's time to come clean

Hey! You come around and I
Hey! You come around and I
Hey! You come around and I can't keep time
Hey! You turn around and I
Hey! You turn around and I
Hey! You turn around and I'm left behind

Eileen says I'm a boy, not a man
Crying on the corner with my head and my hands
I called her name and she ran
Slipping through my fingers like a fist full of sand

Hey! You come around and I
Hey! You come around and I
Hey! You come around and I lose my head
Hey! You turn around and I
Hey! You turn around and I
Hey! You turn around and I'm left for dead

And she reads my mind when I'm sleeping
And she always arrives when I'm leaving
Yeah, she's blocking out the sun it seems
You're a pacifist with a gun, Eileen

Hey! You come around and I
Hey! You come around and I
Hey! You come around and I can't keep time

One life to live but we're doing it wrong
You see, got my brother down cause it's nothing to me
Everyone's saying that it's wrong to cheat
But there's no other way to get my life on easy street

Someone else telling you what you're living for
Been knocking you down, now you're looking for more
The only sound you hear is a closing door
Been looking for peace but they're bringing you war
Rich man's crying cause his money's time
And poor man's smiling cause he knows he ain't blind
There's a man over there says he's tougher than me
But i got eyes that can see through fantasy

I think my life is passing me by
I think my life is passing me by

Take it all back cause it don't mean nothing
If you give it away and you're looking for something back
Wake up every morning when there's nothing there 
No reason to die but no reason to care

Someone else telling you what you're living for 
Been knocking you down now you're looking for more
The only sound you hear is a closing door
Been looking for peace but they're bringing you war
One life to live but we're doing it wrong
You see, got my brother down cause it's nothing to me
Rich man's crying cause his money's time
Poor man's smiling cause he knows he ain't blind

I think my life is passing me by
I think my life is passing me by


Oh the Milky Way has gone a little sour 
The leaves dried and the flower fell away 
I've been sitting, I've been waiting for a sign 
Inhuman beings taking up all of my time 
Want to leave but I've got to stay 
And I'm wondering more everyday 
Montreal to Hong Kong 
Where have all the good people gone? 
Traffic jam but I'm on the shoulder 
Took ten cops to pull me over 
Bangkok to Babylon 
Where have all the good people gone? 
I haven't met a friend in a long long while 
They don't check my head but they check my style 
The modern world is a cold cold world 
And all I meet are cold cold girls 
Wanna leave but I got to stay 
And I'm wondering more every day 
Montreal to Hong Kong 
Where have all the good people gone? 
Traffic jam but I'm on the shoulder 
Took ten cops to pull me over 
Bangkok to Babylon 
Where have all the good people gone? 
And it's always the same 
We all just turn away 
We are stealing from ourselves 
We are feeding off ourselves 
But we were born in the flames 
We need a cool breeze and a summer rain 
We are stealing from ourselves 
We are feeding off ourselves 
Oh the Milky Way has gone a little sour 
The leaves dried and the flower fell away 
Want to leave but I've got to stay 
And I'm wondering more everyday 
Montreal to Hong Kong 
Where have all the good people gone? 
Traffic jam but I'm on the shoulder 
Took ten cops to pull me over 
Bangkok to Babylon 
Where have all the good people gone? 
Time's up and we're running long 
Where have all the good people gone?


There goes my mind
There goes my mind
And it's the same mistake I've made so many times 
that my own mother thinks I'm blind
You can't be true
You can't be true
And I'm spendin' all my money making sure 
that things are going right for you

Startin' all over to the time when everything was alright
When everything was alright
To the time when everything was alright
To the time when everything was alright

You got no love
You got no love
And don't come cryin' home, girl
when you realize that you ain't got no love
I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down
And I'm paranoid of everything 
Yeah, girl you got me livin' underground

Startin' all over to the time when everything was alright
When everything was alright
To the time when everything was alright
To the time when everything was alright

My jaundice went away in 1997
They said your liver's fine now 
but you're never goin' to heaven 
cause of what you done
cause of what you done,
I said listen son, it's cause of what you done!
Yeah!

Startin' all over back then when everything was alright
When everything was alright
When everything was alright
To the time when everything was alright
To the time when everything was alright

Met a girl on a farm we started carrying on, late at night she 
said honey - won't you stay? I said baby that just ain't the 
way I live Uh Huh! 

I had this girl in the south she said you got a big mouth, and 
that ain't right Well I'm no saint, but I ain't bad I'm too busy 
baby just loving the life I have Oh Yeah! 

And I'd stay but I got to move on I ride the wind and I'm gone 

Oh, I'm ready to go I got 19 women on my mind I got 6 lives 
left 'cause I've already died 3 times but I'm fine 

I heard a knock at the door It was a quarter to four I heard 
fee fi fo, fo-fo-fum I'm young, dumb and ready to come alive 
My My!

And I'd stay but I got to move on I ride the wind and I'm gone 
Oh, this is how I live Oh, I got nothing to give 

I took a seat at the bar You know I wouldn't be far Some 
people came and then they went But I ain't leaving till my 
money is spent Oh No!

And I'd stay but I gotta move on 
I ride the wind and I'm gone I ride the wind and I'm gone

And I'd stay but I gotta move on
I ride the wind and I'm gone I ride the wind and I'm gone
Oh yeh! yeh! yeh!
I ride the wind and I'm gone I ride the wind and I'm gooooone
No way! Mother fucker!


Feel, feel it grow
In your mind, in your mind
Life is how you live it 
Through time, through time

And there's no desert sun that is hot enough to feed your fire
We shipwreck like fools only to become the ocean's choir
And the sun dies until it's reborn
But there's no road that ain't a hard road to travel on

Got lost on the way, but you found the road again
Stay true to your friends, 'cause they'll save you in the end

There must be something in the air, in the air
Some kind of answer to my prayers, to my prayers
Some kind of answer to my prayers
Been dying since the day I was born
'Cause there's no road that ain't a hard road to travel on

I have a vision in my mind of a life that I've left behind
Yeah, can't you see that lost souls can't swim
You know you'll sink, but you still jump in
And it's alright to get caught stealing back what you've lost
Yeah, don't you know that lost souls can't swim
You beat them back, but they drag you in
And I can't say that I am sorry for all my many sins

And you try to find the love that'll see you through your darkest days
And her soft brown hair is as long as a Canadian highway
And the sun dies until it's reborn
But there's no road that ain't a hard road to travel on

Been dying since the day I was born
'Cause there's no road that ain't a hard road to travel on

There must be something in the air, in the air
(repeat)


Oh the Milky Way has gone a little sour 
The leaves dried and the flower fell away 
I've been sitting, I've been waiting for a sign 
Inhuman beings taking up all of my time 
Want to leave but I've got to stay 
And I'm wondering more everyday 
Montreal to Hong Kong 
Where have all the good people gone? 
Traffic jam but I'm on the shoulder 
Took ten cops to pull me over 
Bangkok to Babylon 
Where have all the good people gone? 
I haven't met a friend in a long long while 
They don't check my head but they check my style 
The modern world is a cold cold world 
And all I meet are cold cold girls 
Wanna leave but I got to stay 
And I'm wondering more every day 
Montreal to Hong Kong 
Where have all the good people gone? 
Traffic jam but I'm on the shoulder 
Took ten cops to pull me over 
Bangkok to Babylon 
Where have all the good people gone? 
And it's always the same 
We all just turn away 
We are stealing from ourselves 
We are feeding off ourselves 
But we were born in the flames 
We need a cool breeze and a summer rain 
We are stealing from ourselves 
We are feeding off ourselves 
Oh the Milky Way has gone a little sour 
The leaves dried and the flower fell away 
Want to leave but I've got to stay 
And I'm wondering more everyday 
Montreal to Hong Kong 
Where have all the good people gone? 
Traffic jam but I'm on the shoulder 
Took ten cops to pull me over 
Bangkok to Babylon 
Where have all the good people gone? 
Time's up and we're running long 
Where have all the good people gone?


One life to live but we're doing it wrong
You see, got my brother down cause it's nothing to me
Everyone's saying that it's wrong to cheat
But there's no other way to get my life on easy street

Someone else telling you what you're living for
Been knocking you down, now you're looking for more
The only sound you hear is a closing door
Been looking for peace but they're bringing you war
Rich man's crying cause his money's time
And poor man's smiling cause he knows he ain't blind
There's a man over there says he's tougher than me
But i got eyes that can see through fantasy

I think my life is passing me by
I think my life is passing me by

Take it all back cause it don't mean nothing
If you give it away and you're looking for something back
Wake up every morning when there's nothing there 
No reason to die but no reason to care

Someone else telling you what you're living for 
Been knocking you down now you're looking for more
The only sound you hear is a closing door
Been looking for peace but they're bringing you war
One life to live but we're doing it wrong
You see, got my brother down cause it's nothing to me
Rich man's crying cause his money's time
Poor man's smiling cause he knows he ain't blind

I think my life is passing me by
I think my life is passing me by


I found myself on the road to Confusion 
A dull mind and a weak constitution 
I gave a ride to a medicine man 
He had a glass eye and white light in his hand

Now
I wanna run through the green green grass 
Shine a light on the shadows of the past 
I wanna feel like a Siamese twin 
Mass appeal with a solitude spin 

Oh now oh now he stopped my world turning 
Oh now oh now this is a higher learning 
Oh and I bet that you don't even think about it 
Do you now boy? 

When they tell us that we couldn't live without it 
Climbed up to the mountain snow, 

And in the valley we was laid so low 
We will rise like a phoenix from the ashes 

Oh now Oh now this is a higher learning 
Oh now Oh now my eyes are burning 

Come to the light! Come to the light! 
Put your mind in the hands of the medicine man 
Time is a slippery fish now 
Drink deep let your memory slip down 
He says were living underground, 
We've been asleep in a memory, dreaming 
The spell was broken by the sound 
The cut is deep but the wound is healing 
We will rise like a Phoenix from the ashes 
I will rise like a Phoenix from the ashes 
He says he speaks to the monsoon rain 
Drink deep and you'll feel no pain 
I came to on a desolate avenue 
My legs were weak but my mind full of fortitude

Baby thinkin' of you keeps me up all night


You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't want to stay
But every time you come too close I move away

I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time

I don't wanna be so shy
Every time that I'm alone I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me

I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me move slow

Oh, my love 
Oh, yeah yeah
Oh, yeah 


I'm sitting here alone up in my room
I'm thinking about the times that we've been through 
Oh, my love
I'm looking at a picture in my hand
Trying my best to understand
I really want to know what we did wrong 
With a love that felt so strong
If only you were here tonight 
I know that we could make it right 


I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one up in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy


I know I've been a fool since you've been gone
I'd better give it up and carry on 
Oh, my love
'Cause living in a dream of you and me 
Is not the way my life should be
I don't want to cry a tear for you 
So forgive me if I do (ooh)
If only you were here tonight 
I know that we could make it right


I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one up in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy


(Oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
I'd do anything 
I'd give you my world
I'd wait forever to be your girl
(Just call out my name)
Just call out my name (and I will be there) and I will be there (ooh)
Just to show you how much I care (alright) (ooh)
I was born to make you happy, yeah (ooh) (oh yeah)

 
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one up in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
(Oh, oh)
I was born to make you happy 
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy


"Never look back," we said

How was I to know I'd miss you so?

Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind

Where do I go?



And you didn't hear

All my joy through my tears

All my hopes through my fears

Did you know, still I miss you somehow





From the bottom of my broken heart

There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know

You were my first love, you were my true love

From the first kisses to the very last rose

From the bottom of my broken heart

Even though time may find me somebody new

You were my real love, I never knew love

'Til there was you

From the bottom of my broken heart



"Baby," I said, "please stay.

Give our love a chance for one more day"

We could have worked things out

Taking time is what love's all about



But you put a dart

Through my dreams through my heart

And I'm back where I started again

Never thought it would end







You promised yourself

But to somebody else

And you made it so perfectly clear

Still I wish you were here







"Never look back," we said

How was I to know I'd miss you so?


Oh yeah



You don't have to say what's on your mind

'Cause I know where you've been

Give it up and leave it all behind

And then let me begin



Come on over here

Let me show how things should be

I will make it alright

Let me make it clear

You can put your trust in me

Yes I will be there





When you need someone

You just turn around

And I, will be there

When you're feeling low

Baby let me know

And I, will be there



Won't you let me make it up to you

Now you know where I am

There ain't nothin that I wouldn't do

Just to love once again



Come on over here

Let me show how things should be

I will make it alright

Let me make it clear

You can put your trust in me

Yes I will be there







I will be there

Just take a stand

I'll be here for you

Now and forever

Give one more chance

To show you how much I care

I'll be there



When you need someone

I just turn around

And I will be there

When you're in sorrow

Just let me know and I will be there






 Time may take us apart, but I will still love you. I promise

 And when the stars, stars are falling, I'll keep calling

 I promise that you'll be my one my only everything, I'll never be untrue

 And I promise back that for your love I will do anything

 I will give you the stars

 I will buy you the moon

 And even through longest of our nights

 And Even through the darkest days our

 Love will find away





And when the stars are falling, I'll keep calling

I will still love you

And when your dreams are fading, I'll be waiting

I will still love you



 You are my summer breeze my winter sun, my springtime soul, my autumn touch of gold

 You are my sky my rain a way which my love flows cuz you're all

 The smile of my heart and the breathe of my soul

 Even if we find ourselves apart

 We will hold out hopes and dreams

 Forever in our hearts







 Tell me how you feel

 I finally know how to feel. Tell me if it's real

 And my heart is tells me it's real

 So real, so real







 Time will take us apart that's true

But I will always be there for you

Your in my heart and you'll be in my dreams

No matter how many miles between

I promise you that I won't forget

The day we kissed or the day we met

The sky may fall and the stars my too

But I will still, I will still love you






Oh, oh-oh

Oh, oh, oh-oh



Friends say, I'm away

Because I'm down with you every day

They say, break away

I'm missing out on the fun and games

But you smile and the words they tell me quickly disappear

You speak and there is no other voice that I can hear



I spend my days (ooh, ooh)

With you (I spend my days)

I spend my nights (my nights)

thinkin' about you (thinking about you babe)

I spend my days (all day, all night)

With you (with you)

I spend my nights (my nights)

thinkin' about you



You stay on my mind, oh

And i think about you all the time (all the time)

Day and night

Feels so right

And for us there is no end in sight, ooh

Each day that I spend around you

Passes by too fast

Each night that I spend without you

Is longer than the last



I spend my days (I spend my days)

With you (thinking about you babe)

I spend my nights (my nights)

thinkin' about you (all day, all night)

I spend my days (my days)

With you (thinking about you)

I spend my days (all day, all night)

With you (all day, all night)


It's been hours seems like days, since you went away,

And all I do is check the screen to see if you're ok.

You don't answer when I phone, guess you wanna be left alone.

So I'm sending my heart, my soul, and this is what I'll say:





I'm sorry, oh so sorry, can't you give me one more chance to make it all up to you.

E-mail my heart and say our love will never die

and that I know you're out there and I know that you still care.

Email me back and say our love will stay alive.

Forever, Email my heart.



Whoa

I can see you in my mind, coming on the line

And opening this letter that I've sent a hundred times.

Here's a picture of us two, I look so good on you

and can't you please forgive me for the hurt I put you through.







I'm sorry, oh so sorry, can't you give me one more chance to make it all up to (you).



E-mail my heart and say our love will never die

and that I know you're out there and I know that you still care

(I know that you still care...)

Email me back and say our love will stay alive

Forever (Won't ya say, Won't ya say)

Forever, Forever

Email my heart

You ever want something 

that you know you shouldn't have 

The more you know you shouldn't have it, 

The more you want it 

And then one day you get it, 

It's so good too 

But it's just like my girl 

When she's around me 

I just feel so good, so good 

But right now I just feel cold, so cold 

Right down to my bones 

'Cause ooh... 

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 

It's not warm when she's away 

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 

And she's always gone too long 

Anytime she goes away 



Wonder this time where she's gone 

Wonder if she's gone to stay 

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 

And this house just ain't no home 

Anytime she goes away 



I know, I know, I know, I know, 

I know, know, know, know, know, 

I know, I know, 

Hey I ought to leave 

I ought to leave her alone 

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 



Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 

Only darkness every day 

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 

And this house just ain't no home 

Anytime she goes away


Can it be I stayed away too long

Did I leave your mind when I was gone

It's not my thing trying to get back

But this time let me tell you where I'm at

You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming

Back to where I should have always stayed

And now I've heard the maybe to your story

And it's enough love for me to stay



Can it be I stayed away too long

Did I leave your mind when I was gone

It's not my thing trying to get back

But this time let me tell you where I'm at





I wanna, wanna be where you are

Anywhere you are

I wanna, wanna be where you are

Everywhere you are





Please don't close the door to our future

There's so many things we haven't tried

I could love you better than I used to

And give you all the love I have inside





I wanna, wanna be where you are

Any, any, anywhere you are

I wanna, wanna be where you are

I gotta be where you are


Oooh

Foolish of me, I couldn't see 

The forest for the trees 

You've been so true 

I've been so cruel to you 

Oh, girl please don't leave me





If you stay I'll find a way 

To erase the past 

Baby don't leave me 

Girl don't take your love from me 

Oh girl 



What can I say to make you stay 

Baby, don't leave me 

You've been so kind 

It blows my mind to know

Oh girl, I really hurt you 





Tell me girl, it's not to late 

And you give me a chance 

To make it up to you 

Don't take your love from me 

Girl don't take your love 

Don't take your love 





Girl, if you take your love away from me 

I'm gonna be in misery 

Your love is the strength that I lean upon 

How will I make it when it's gone 

Of all the little things I wanted to say.... 

...I really wanted to do

Girl , this time...

Ooh, oh girl I really mean it 





So tell me girl, it's not too late 

And you'll give me a chance 

To make it up to you 

Don't take your love from me 

Don't take your love, no no no no no

Don't take your love

Don't leave me girl 



Don't take your love from me 

Baby, don't take your love from me 

Don't take your love from me 

Oooh, don't take your love from me 

Baby, don't take your love from me




Maybe you and I can't do great things

We may not change the world in one day

But we still can change some things today... 

In our small way



Empty words are not enough

Where there's hurt we'll be a crush

When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup

Because we care we love enough to share





Maybe you and I can't do great things

We may not change the world in one day

But we still can change some things today... 

In our small way



In despair we'll be the hope

And the prayer that frees the soul

We'll be there to share each lonely road

Because we love, I know

We care enough





Maybe you and I can't do great things

We may not change the world in one day

But we still can change some things today... 

In our small way



Just a little time is all it takes

What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see

Love is all we need





Maybe you and I can't do great things

We may not change the world in one day

But we still can change some things today... 

In our small way


Got to be there, got to be there 

In the morning 

When she says hello to the world 

Got to be there, got to be there 

Bring her good times 

And show her that she's my girl 

Oh what a feeling there'll be 

The moment I know she loves me 

'Cause when I look in her eyes I realize 

I need her sharing her world beside me 



So I've got to be there 

Got to be there in the morning 

And welcome her into my world 

And show her that she is my girl 

When she says, "Hello world!" 

I need her sharing the world beside me 



That's why I've got to be there 

Got to be there where love begins 

And that's everywhere she goes 

I've got to be there so she knows 

That when she's with me, she's home 



Got to be there 

Got to be there


He rocks in the tree tops all day long 

Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song 

All the little birdies on Jaybird Street 

Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet 





Rockin' robin, rock rock

Rockin' robin' 

Blow rockin' robin 

'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight 



Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee 

Every little bird in the tall oak tree 

The wise old owl, the big black crow 

Flappin' their wings singing go bird go 







Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand 

Told them how to do the bop and it was grand 

They started going steady and bless my soul 

He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriol 



He rocks in the tree tops all day long 

Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song 

All the little birdies on Jaybird Street 

Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet 






When this old world gets you down 

When your spirit's on the ground 

Just remember I will always be around 

Just climb on the wings of my love 

I'll take you high on the wings of my love 

When you're feeling all alone 

Like a child who's got no home 

You know you've always got a place where you can go 

Just climb on the wings of my love 



Like a beach that knows no boundaries with all the trees 

As it rushes to the seas darling we'll be just as free 

I'll lift your spirits high our love will fly 

We'll have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine 



'Til you break those ties that bind 

'Til that day you're really mine 

Anytime you want to leave your world behind 

Just climb on the wings of my love 



I'll lift your spirits high our love will fly 

We'll have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine 



We've got rainbows yet to find 

And we'll find them all in time 

Girl you know someday we'll even touch the sky 

Just climb on the wings of my love 



Anytime you want to leave your world behind 

I'll take you high on the wings of my love 

Just take my hand and together we'll touch the sky 

Just climb on the wings of my love 

Yes remember I will always be around 

I'll take you high on the wings of my love

I'm so lonely I'm so blue 

Without you darling my life is through 

Come on back


Love is here

And oh my darling, now you're gone

Love is here

And oh my darling, now you're gone

You persuaded me to love you

And I did

But instead of tendeness

I found heartache instead

Into your arms I fell

So unaware of the lonelyness

Thar was waiting there





You closed the door to your heart, girl

And you turned the key

Locked your love away from me



Love is here

And oh my darling, now you're gone

You made me love you

And oh my darling, now you're gone

You said loving you

Would make life beautiful

With each passing day

But as soon as love came

Into my heart

You turned and you walked

Just walked away





You stripped me of my dreams

You gave me faith, then you took my hope

Look at me now



Look at me

See what loving has done to me

Look at my face

See how cryin' has left its trace

After you made me all your own

Then you left me all alone

You made your words sound so sweet

Knowing that your love I couldn't keep





My heart cries out for your tuch

But baby, you're not there

And the lonely cry fades in the air



Love is here

And oh my darling, now you're gone

Love is here

And oh my darling, now you're gone

You made me love you

Oh oh my darling, now you're gone

Talking 'bout love, love, love, love,

Ooh ooh my darling, now you're gone


When you're down and trubled 

And you need some love and care 

And nothin', no nothin' is goin' right 

Just close your eyes and think of me 

And soon I'll be there to brighten up 

Yeah, even your darkest night 

You just call out my name 

And you know, wherever I am 

I'll come a-runnin' 

To see you again 





Winter, spring, summer or fall 

All you have to do is call 

And I'll be there, yeah I will 

You've got a friend 



When the sky above you 

Grows dark and full of clouds 

And that old north wind 

He begins to blow 

Here's what you do baby 

Keep your head together 

And call my name out loud 

And soon you'll hear me 

Knockin' at your door 

Oh yes I will, yes I will 

You just call out my name 

And you know, wherever I am 

I'll come a-runnin' 

To see you again 







Ain't it good to know 

That you've got a friend 

People can be so cold 

They'll hurt you and desert you 

And take your soul if you let them 

Oh, don't let them 





Winter, spring, summer or fall 

All you have to do is call 

And I'll be there, yes I will 



You've got a friend, yes you do 

You've got a friend, yes you do 

Right till the end, for you 

Ain't it good to know

Two hearts that beat as one, send signals

To each other in whispers...

To describe (the way I feel when you are near)

Whenever you are by my side

What I feel inside is deep and I just don't know

What to say (because my words get in the way)

Everytime I try to say (I love you) what I feel

Deep inside






You took my heart and ran away

Forever in my heart you'll stay

No matter what we've been through

I'm going to keep on loving you



It's not the way that I feel

Cause I'm really in love with you (ahh yeah)

You stole my heart then you ran away

Cause I still feel the same way

The love I have for you will never grow old (oh no)





My life had changed because of you

And I need you right here with me

As far as I can see

You're the one for me











Every night and day

Thinking of you by my side

Here with me is where you ought to be

Akon (akon) 

C'mon





This is the ultimate journey of your life 

Where the weak die and the strong survive 

Prepare to suffer 40 days and 40 nights 

Strap on your boots because you got a long hike 





Just another journey, another journey into time 

C'mon now 

Just another journey, who ever thought I'd cross this line 

Ohohohohoh 







Walking through the dirty streets of Jersey (Jersey) 

A dollar to my name searchin for that key 

I'm tryin not to reincorinate my past 

I'm tired from the game, took another path 

Destination 95 Dirty South 

Where the devil tried to realter my route 

Creator took me by the hand and led the way-ay 

to make the story short thats why I'm here today 







What about that day you said I wouldn't amount to shit

And about that day you kicked me out onto the bricks 

What about that time you said I wouldnt make a dime 

And about that time you said I couldn't make you mine 

Destination to the bank overseas 

Where Akons treated like royalty 

Cause there's so much in this world i have to see-e 

The wagon's rolling so jump in a follow me-e 







Born and raised in Africa trying to make a scene 

(trying to make a scene) 

The best way to get to you is by this music thing 

And you might believe 







Akon (Akon) 

C'mon (c'mon)



Lets take it to the streets

I traveled through the ghettos of America

Lets take it to the streets

I traveled through the ghettos of Africa

Lets take it to the streets

I traveled through the ghettos of Asia

Lets take it to the streets

I traveled through the ghettos all over







In my journey yea (yea, yea)


>> houston

I found out what I've been missing 

Always on the run 

I've been looking for someone 





Now you're here like you've been before 

And you know just what I need 

It took some time for me to see 

That you give good love to me baby 

So good, take this heart mine into your hands 

You give good love to me 

Never too much 

Baby you give good love 



Never stopping, I was always searching 

For that perfect love 

The kind that girls like me dream of 







Now I, I can't stop looking around 

It's not, what this loves all about 

Our love is here to stay, stay 






I can't get you off my mind 

No matter what I do 

I'm wishing you were here, with me 

It makes no difference 

I only think of you 

And I living out my fantasy 





Late at night, a rendezvous 

Being such a love sick fool 

It might be pouring rain 

But still the same, nothings changed 

All and all I feel no shame 

I'm just your fool the same 

(I'm just your fool) 

(I keep thinking about you baby) 

So tell me what you're gonna do 

(I keep thinking about you) 

All I wanna do is 

(Like a river of wine, intoxicate my mind 

I'm thinking about you) 

That's what I wanna do 

(Pick me up, let's go down 

I'm thinking about it too) 

(I'm thinking about you) 

Ya got me thinking about you 

(I'm thinking about it too) 



Maybe weeping is a game 

That's hard for me to face 

(But you need me) 

Just like I need you 

There's no reason 

Just my heart that makes me feel this way 

And I hope you feel the same way too 







It might be pouring rain 

But like a fool, insane 

I run to you 

I'm just a love sick fool 

I've got this thing for you (I'm just a love-sick fool) 





words and music by: Kashif, LaLa


(Someone for me) 

(Someone for me) 

I'm here alone on a Friday night 

Waiting here beside the phone 

The TV, radio, and me 

Really ain't been getting along 

I wish that I could find a way 

To party to the break of day 

And there I'd be sure to meet 

The guy that would be special to me 

Then momma comes and asks me 

Why I am dreaming, sitting alone 

Why not go out and have some fun 

It's the only way I'll ever 

Find someone for me 

While I am young and seventeen 





Someone for me (someone for me) 

I've got to find someone 

Someone (someone for me) 

I've got to find someone 



Now there's a party down at Angie's house 

With people packed against the walls 

I'm sitting in a corner here 

Trying to make sense of it all 

And when I least expect it 

Meeting a guy I see in my dreams 

Here he is walking up to me 

And asking if I'd like to come and dance with him 

I think I found someone for me 





I need somebody for me 

I need somebody for me, someone 

And so I'm finding out that 

Dreams you believe in, can come to be 

And now I'm looking up to find that joy 

And happiness can come to you and me 

I actually found someone for me 






A few stolen moments is all that we share 
You've got your family, and they need you there 
Though I've tried to resist, being last on your list 
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy, living all alone 
My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own 
But each time I try, I just break down and cry 
Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue 
So I'm saving all my love for you 

You used to tell me we'd run away together 
Love gives you the right to be free 
You said be patient, just wait a little longer 
But that's just an old fantasy 
I've got to get ready, just a few minutes more 
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door 
For tonight is the night, for feeling alright 
We'll be making love the whole night through 
So I'm saving all my love 
Yes I'm saving all my love 
Yes I'm saving all my love for you 

No other woman, is gonna love you more 
Cause tonight is the night, that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through 
So I'm saving all my love 
Yeah I'm saving all my love 
Yes I'm saving all my love for you 
For you, for you


Like a candle burning bright

Love is glowing in your eyes

A flame to light our way

That burns brighter everyday

But now I have you

Nobody loves me like you do



Like a leaf upon the wind

I could find no place to land

I dreamed the hours away

And wondered everyday

Do dreams come true

Nobody loves me like you do





What if I'd never met you

Where would I be right now

Funny how life just falls in place somehow

You've touched my heart in places that I never even knew

Cause nobody loves me like you do



I was words without a tune

I was a song still unsung



A poem with no rhyme

A dancer out of time

But now there's you

Baby, nobody loves me like you do






There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of 
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above 
Ooh I lose control, can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love


How will I know (Don't trust your feelings) 
How will I know 
How will I know (Love can be deceiving) 
How will I know 
How will I know if he really loves me 
I say a prayer with every heart beat 
I fall in love whenever we meet 
I'm asking you what you know about these things 
How will I know if he's thinking of me 
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak) 
Falling in love is all bitter sweet 
This love is strong why do I feel weak

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now 
Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love 



If he loves me, if he loves me not 




All at once, 
I finally took a moment and I'm realizing that 
Your not coming back 
And it finally hit me all at once 
All at once, 
I started counting teardrops and at least a million fell 
My eyes began to swell, 
And all my dreams were shattered all at once 


Ever since I met you 
You're the only love I've known 
And I can't forget you 
Though I must face it all alone 
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely see 
Wishing you'd come back to me 
And that's all that matters now 
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Holding on to memories 
And it hurts me more than you know 
So much more than it shows 
All at once 

All at once,
I looked around and found that you were with another love 
In someone else's arms,
And all my dreams were shattered, all at once 
All at once
The smile that used to greet me brightened someone else's day 
She took your smile away
And left me with just memories, all at once 




Time can pass so slowly, when you feel so all alone 

Love can strike like lightning, when you find your heart a home 

I've seen it in the movies, read about it in a book 

I've never feel it, but your touch was all it took 





Take good care of my heart 

Take good care of my heart 

Baby you're the first to take it 

You're the only one who can break it 

I love you more than I should 

But it keeps me feeling so good 

I've waited for your love for ever 

You're the one to take good care of my heart 



Come and make you're magic, til you have me hypnotised 

If we get any closer, I'll be drowning in your eyes 

You're the one I needed most, when my love was on the line 

I'm so glad you gave me yours, when I gave you mine 






I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me


I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be



And if, by chance, that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love


I'll hold you, and touch you 

And make you my woman 

And give you my love with sweet surrender 

Tonight our hearts will beat as one 

And I will hold you, touch you 

And make you my woman tonight 



There's something in your eyes I see 

A pure and simple honesty 





Hold me in your arms tonight 

Fill my life with pleasure 

Let's not waste this precious time 

This moment's ours to treasure 

Hold me in your arms tonight 

We'll make it last forever 

When the morning sun appears 

We'll find our way together 



I believe you when you say that you love me 

Know that I won't take you for granted 

Tonight the magic has begun 

So won't you hold me, touch me 

Make me your woman tonight 



There's something in your eyes I see 

I won't betray your trust in me 







I'll hold you 

And touch you 

And make you my woman (make me your woman) tonight






>> westlife


I wanna know
Who ever told you I was letting go
Of the only joy that I have ever known
Girl, they were lying

Just look around
And all of the people that we used to know
Have just given up, they wanna let it go
But we're still trying

So you should know this love we share was never made to die
I'm glad we're on this one way street just you and I 
Just you and I

All:
I'm never gonna say goodbye
Cos I never wanna see you cry
I swore to you my love would remain
And I swear it all over again and I
I'm never gonna treat you bad
Cos I never wanna see you sad
I swore to share your joy and your pain
And I swear it all over again


All over again 

Some people say
That everything has got its place in time
Even the day must give way to the night
But I'm not buying
Cos in your eyes
I see a love that burns eternally
And if you see how beautiful you are to me
You'll know I'm not lying

Sure there'll be times we wanna say goodbye
But even if we try
There are some things in this life won't be denied
Won't be denied


I'm never gonna say goodbye
Cos I never wanna see you cry
I swore to you my love would remain
And I swear it all over again and I
I'm never gonna treat you bad
Cos I never wanna see you sad
I swore to share your joy and your pain
And I swear it all over again


The more I know of you is the more I know I love you
And the more that I'm sure I want you forever and ever more
And the more that you love me, the more that I know
Oh that I'm never gonna let you go
Gotta let you know that I


I'm never gonna say goodbye

(I'm never gonna say goodbye)

Cos I never wanna see you cry

(never wanna see you cry) All:
I swore to you my love would remain
And I swear it all over again and I

(swear it all over again and I)

I'm never gonna treat you bad

(never gonna treat you bad)

Cos I never wanna see you sad

(never wanna see you sad)

I swore to share your joy and your pain

(oh no, oh no)

And I swear it all over again


All over again
All over again
And I swear it all over again



Day after day
Time passed away 
And I just can't get you off my mind 
Nobody knows, I hide it inside 
I keep on searching but I can't find 


The courage to show to letting you know
I've never felt so much love before 


And once again I'm thinking about 
Taking the easy way out 


But if I let you go I will never know 
What my life would be holding you close to me 
Will I ever see you smiling back at me? ( oh yeah) 
How will I know
 if I let you go? 


Night after night I hear myself say 
Why can't this feeling just fade away 
There's no one like you (no one like you) 
You speak to my heart (speak to my heart) 
It's such a shame we're worlds apart 


I'm too shy to ask, I'm too proud to lose 
But sooner or later I gotta choose 
And once again I'm thinking about 
Taking the easy way out 


But if I let you go I will never know 
What my life would be, holding you close to me 
Will I ever see you smiling back at me? (oh yeah) 
How will I know
 if I let you go ? 


If I let you go ooooh baby 
Ooooooooohhhhh 


Once again I'm thinking about 
Taking the easy way out 
Ooooooooohhhhh 


But if I let you go I will never know 
What my life would be, holding you close to me
( close to me)
Will I ever see you smiling back at me?
( oh yeah) 
How will I know
( if I let you go?) 
But if I let you go I will never know 
( oh baby) 
Will I ever see you smiling back at me?
( oh yeah) 
How will I know
 if I let you go ?



Everybody's looking for a something
One thing that makes it all complete
You'll find it in the strangest places
Places you never knew it could be

Some find it in the face of their children
Some find it in their lover's eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you've found that special thing
You're flying without wings


Some find it sharing every morning
Some in their solitary nights
You'll find it in the words of others
A simple line can make you laugh or cry

You'll find it in the deepest friendship
The kind you cherish all your life
And when you know how much it means
You've found that special thing
You're flying without wings

So, impossible as it may seem
You've got to fight for every dream
'Cause who's to know which one you let go
Would have made you complete


Well, for me it's waking up beside you
To watch the sunrise on your face
To know that I can say I love you
In any given time or place


It's little things that only I know
Those are the things that make you mine
And it's like flying without wings
'Cause you're my special thing
I'm flying without wings


And you're the place my life begins
And you'll be where it ends


I'm flying without wings
And that's the joy you bring
I'm flying without wings



Baby
I know the story,
I've seen the picture
It's written all over your face
Tell me
What's the secret
That you've been hiding
And who's gonna take my place

I should have seen it coming
I should've read the signs
Anyway...
I guess it's over


Can't believe that I'm the fool again,
I thought this love would never end 
How was I to know?
You never told me,
Can't believe that I'm the fool again 
And I who thought you were my friend,
How was I to know?
You never told me.


Baby
You should have called me
When you were lonely
When you needed me to be there
Sadly
You never gave me
Too many chances
To show you how much I care

I should have seen it coming
I should've read the signs
Anyway...
I guess it's over




About the pain and the tears,
oh oh oh,
If I could I would,
Turn back the time


Ooh yeah
I should've seen it coming
I should've read the signs
Anyway...
I guess it's over




No no no no

Once,
we had it all for the taking,
love was just me and you,
You better think twice,
about the plans that you're making,
of splitting one word in two,

Put your mind in doubt,
did you ever think about,
everything that we're missing,
Don't you make me see,
what is best for me,
cause I just won't listen, baby

no no no no 
I don't need nobody,
anyone to take your place but you,
no no no no 
I just couldn't fall for anyone new,
nobody but you,

Girl,

I just can't go on without you,
Let's make it alright,
wake up to what we've been given,
remember the things we've been through, 

Put your mind in doubt, 
did you ever think about, 
everything that we're missing,
Don't you make me see,
what is best for me,
cause I just won't listen, baby 

no no no no
I don't need nobody,
anyone to take your place but you,
no no no no 
I just couldn't fall for anyone new,
nobody but you, 

I can't imagine,
the two of us apart, 
Can't find a reason,
cause I still believe,
There's no one like you,
that is why I need, 
nobody but you,

don't need nobody, 
yeahhhhhh.........
To take your place but you, 
no no no no no no
Don't need nobody at all,
no no no no no no

no no no no 
I don't need nobody, 
(don't need nobody)

no no no no no no
I just couldn't fall for anyone new,
nobody but you


I can't sleep,

everything i ever knew,

Is a lie, 

without you,



I can't breathe,

when my heart is broke in two,

There's no beat,

without you,



You're not gone,

but you're not here,

At least that's the way it seems tonight,

If we could try to end these wars,

I know that we can make it right,

cause baby,



I don't wanna fight no more,

I forgot what we were fighting for,

and this lonelyness that's in my heart,

won't let me be apart from you,



I don't wanna have to try,

Girl, to live without you in my life,

So, i'm hoping we can start tonight,

cause i don't wanna fight,

no more,



How can I leave,

when everything that I adore,

and everything I'm living for,

Girl, it's in you,



I can't dream,

sleepless nights have got me bad,

The only dream i ever had,

is being with you,



I know that we can make it right,

It's gonna take a little time,

Lets not leave ourselves with no way out,

lets not cross that line,(that line)



I don't wanna fight no more,

I forgot what we were fighting for,

and this lonelyness that's in my heart,

won't let me be apart from you,



I don't wanna have to try,

Girl, to live without you in my life,

So, i'm hoping we can start tonight,

cause i don't wanna fight, 

no more,



Remember that i made a vow,

that i would never let you go,

I meant it then, I mean it now,

and i want to tell you so,



I don't wanna fight no more, (oh no)

I forgot what we were fighting for,

and this lonelyness that's in my heart,

won't let me be apart from you,



I don't wanna have to try,

Girl, to live without you in my life,

So, i'm hoping we can start tonight, 

(can we start)

cause i don't wanna fight, 

no more...



I don't wanna fight no more,

I forgot what we were fighting for, (oh yeah)

and this lonelyness that's in my heart,

(my heart)

won't let me be apart from you,



I don't wanna have to try,

Girl, to live without you in my life,

So, i'm hoping we can start tonight,

(I'm hoping)

cause i don't wanna fight,

no more.......



It's all a lie,

Without you,

without you......


Since you've gone, 
well it seems like everything is wrong,
And deep inside, 
I know that i've,
lost much more than pride,
Well, happiness is getting further away,
Girl,i miss you more than words can say,
I need a miracle now,
so tell me,

How can i change the world,
Cause i sure can't change your mind,
Where's the miracle i need now,
got to get to you somehow,
Cause i can't change the world,
I can't change the world,
No, i can't change the world,
I can't change the world,

Losing you,
well it's been the hardest thing to do,
So, i close my eyes and tell myself,
that somehow i'll survive,
Well you gave me heaven,
then you took it away,
Girl, i miss you more with each passing day,
i need a miracle now,
so tell me...

How can i change the world, (change it)
Cause i sure can't change your mind,
Where's the miracle i need now,
got to get to you somehow,

And baby,
so sad that you have to leave me,
just so you can find yourself,
And it's so sad that you just can't see,
I love you more than life itself,

No, i can't change the world,

How can i change the world,
Cause i sure can't change your mind,
Where's the miracle i need now,
got to get to you somehow,
Cause i can't change the world,
got to get to you somehow,
No, i can't change the world.....


If i die tonight,
I'd go with no regrets,
If it's in your arms,
I know that i was blessed,
And if your eyes,
are the last thing that i see,
Then i know the beauty heaven holds for me,

But if i make it through, 
If i live to see the day,
If i'm with you, 
I'll know just what to say,
the truth be told, 
Girl, you take my breath away,
every minute, every hour, every day,

Cause every moment,
we share together,
is even better, 
than the moment before,
If every day was, 
as good as today was,
then i can't wait until tomorrow comes,

A moment in time,
is all that's given you and me,
A moment in time, 
and it's something you should seize,
So i won't make,(i won't make)
the mistake of letting go, 
Everyday you're here,
i'm gonna let you know,

That every moment,
we share together,
is even better, 
than the moment before,
If every day was, 
as good as today was,
then i can't wait until tomorrow comes,

Each morning that i get up, 
(each morning i'll wait),
I love you more than ever,
(i love you more)
So girl i'll never, 
go away, never stray,

So every moment,
we share together,
is even better, 
than the moment before,
If every day was,
as good as today was,
then i can't wait until tomorrow comes,

Every moment, 
we share together,
is even better, 
than the moment before,
If every day was, 
as good as today was,
then i can't wait until tomorrow comes,

I love, love, love the moments, 
(oh yeah)
Moments we share together,
I love, love, love the moments,
(oh yeah)
I pray they'd last forever,

I love, love, love the moments, 
(oh yeah)
Moments we share together,
I love, love, love the moments, 
(oh yeah)
I pray they'd last forever now..........



Goodbye to you my trusted friend 
We've known each other since we were nine or ten 
Together we've climbed hills and trees 
Learned of love and ABC's 
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees 


Goodbye my friend it's hard to die 
When all the birds are singing in the sky 
Now that spring is in the air 
Pretty girls are everywhere 
Think of me and I'll be there 


We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun 
But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time 


Goodbye Papa please pray for me 
I was the black sheep of the family 
You tried to teach me right from wrong 
Too much wine and too much song 
Wonder how I got along 


Goodbye papa it's hard to die 
When all the birds are singing in the sky 
Now that the spring is in the air 
Little children everywhere 
When you see them I'll be there


We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun 
But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone 
We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun 
But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone 


Goodbye Michelle my little one 
You gave me love and helped me find the sun 
And every time that I was down 
You would always come around 
And get my feet back on the ground 


Goodbye Michelle it's hard to die 
When all the birds are singing in the sky 
Now that the spring is in the air
With the flowers everywhere 
I wish that we could both be there 


We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun 
But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time 
We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun 
But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone 
We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun 
But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time 
We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun 
But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone


Baby,baby,
I swear to you,
Baby,baby, 
I'm here for you,

I don't know why,
why i did those things to you,
what went through my mind,
And i don't know why,
why i broke your heart in two,
guess that i was blind,

Baby how i wish you could forgive me,
just one more time,baby...

And i swear,
I'll be there,
anytime you want me to,
I'll be true,
here for you,
Don't leave me lonely,
cause i need you,

Guess i've been a fool,
Now i can see the price to pay,
I can't run and hide,
Cause i'm loosing you,
and my chances slipped away,
with each time i lied,

Baby how i wish you could forgive me,
One more time, 
oh yeah

And i swear,(and i swear)
I'll be there,(i'll be there)
anytime you want me to,
yeah,
I'll be true(i'll be true)
here for you,
Don't leave me lonely,
cause i need you,

Baby, 
Living without you,
will tear me apart,
When i know how it could have been,
But i don't care what it leads to,
let's make a new start,
and give love a chance to win,
cause,baby i swear,

Baby,baby, 
I swear to you,
anytime you want me to,
Yes i swear,
Baby, baby,
I'm here for you,
don't leave me lonely,
Cause i need you, (i need you)

And i swear,
I'll be there,
anytime you want me to,
yeah,
I'll be true,
here for you,
Don't leave me lonely,
Cause i need you, (cause i need you)

And i swear,(you know i'll be) 
I'll be there,(i will be there)
(i swear) I'll be true,(i will be true)
Don't leave me lonely,
Cause i need you,
Yes baby i need you.......

My love

I'll never find the words, my love

To tell you how I feel, my love

Mere words could not explain

Precious love

You held my life within your hands

Created everything I am

Taught me how to live again



Only you

Cared when I needed a friend

Believed in me thick and thin

This song is for you

Filled with gratitude and love



God bless you

You make me feel brand new

For God blessed me with you

You made me feel brand new

I sing this song 'cause you

Make me feel brand new



My love

Whenever I was insecure

You built me up and made me sure

You gave my pride back to me

Precious friend

With you I'll always have a friend

You're someone who I can depend

To walk a path that never ends



Without you

My life has no meaning or rhyme

Like notes to a song out of time

How can I repay

You for having faith in me






Let's take our time and concentrate

The mood is right for living, ooh I can't wait

I've waited so long to be with you this special way

Don't be afraid, afraid to stay

And share your love with me this way



I understand baby it's your very first time

I'll be gentle with you baby, it's gonna be alright

And so if we're gonna be together tonight

I'll be good to you baby, sweet to you lady

Guess what we're gonna be tonight



Lovers

Baby, let me be your lover

Lovers

Let me be the only one

Lovers

Baby let me be your lover

Lovers

Let me be the one



Don't let your thoughts get in the way

The time is right for love, it's not too late

The feeling's so strong to be as one this special way

Just take my hand, I'll lead the way

I need you so much, baby won't you stay



I understand baby it's your very first time

I'll be gentle with you baby, it's gonna be alright

And so if we're gonna be together tonight

I'll be good to you baby, sweet to you lady

Guess what we're gonna be tonight















I wanna hold you

I wanna touch you

I wanna squeeze you

I'll never tease you

Hold you tight all through the night

I'm gonna make you feel alright



Lovers


My friends tell me

That he's been cheating on you

And that he treats you unkindly

He's using you

My friends tell me

That he keeps messing around

And that your love is so blinded

You think that it's it cool



Well, he never sends you roses

He never kisses you goodnight

He never thinks about your anniversary

He says he don't have time



Well, I might be wrong to think

A little bit confused

That a girl like you is too beautiful

For a guy like him to use



What ever happened to chivalry

What ever happened to love and true honesty

What ever happened to chivalry

What ever happened to love and true honesty



My friends tell me

That he's been bragging about

All of the girls that he's doing

All over town

My friends tell me

He's putting you down

And you're so in love you can't tell

He is turning you out



Well, he never sends love letters

He never takes you out at night

He never wines and dines your heart

He says he don't have time



Well, I might be wrong to think

A little bit confused

That a girl like you is too beautiful

For a guy like him to use






Love never came between us

For love was too deep in our hearts

It's the silly things we do between us

That managed to tear us apart

But oh I believe if we work real hard

We can get through, through it this time

Girl just trust me and I will trust you

There'll be nothing that we can't get through



I love you, babe

In the scariest way

I want you, babe

To stay with me

I love you, babe

Though I'm hurtin' to say

I want you, babe

To stay with me

I love you, babe

In the scariest way

I want you, babe

To stay with me

I love you, babe

Though I'm hurtin' to say

I want you, babe

To stay with me



Trust never came between us

And that's just the way that we are

It's the crazy things we do between us

That managed to break both our hearts

But oh I believe that we can survive

Through anything if we'd only try











Baby, stay, won't you stay

Baby, stay, with me.....


Oh Mary Mack

All dressed in black

With silver buttons

All down her back

Say you found another lover

Instead of me

Tell ya what I'm gonna do

I'm gon' set you free



Girl

When you leave my sight

When you go

It's no mystery

I'm not blind

To your whereabouts

And it's time

You came clean with me

In your heart

You belong to me

But it's clear

Where you'd rather be

And though it hurts

And it could break my heart

Baby I wanna know

When it concerns me



All I wanna know

Is when he kissed your lips

Did it feel the same as me

And if it does

Then I will let you go

I will bow out gracefully



Oh Mary Mack

Oh Mary Mack



Babe

If your love is real

Then you

Would not lie to me

Ooh girl

And if you love me still

Then explain

Explain this hotel key

It's kinda sad

After all I've done

That you

Would turn your back on me

Was it love

Or did he twist your arm

To make you turn away

Turn away from me







All I wanna know







All I wanna know

All I wanna know



Oh Mary Mack

All dressed in black

With silver buttons

All down her back

Say you found another lover

Instead of me

Tell ya what I'm gonna do

I'm gon' set you free







All I wanna know



All I wanna know



All I wanna know



All I wanna know


You've been hanging out without your girlfriends

And they've been hanging out at all the clubs

And you've been making eyes at all their boyfriends

Have I complained? Not even once



So tell me how can you

Expect me to be cool

While you're playing silly games with my love

Darlin' I won't accept you

Putting blame on me

You know that I'm the innocent one



Now haven't I been faithful

Haven't I been true

But you're not even grateful

Hey, what's a guy to do







You've been talking to your ex-girlfriends

They're always calling you up on the phone

Yet you insist they really don't mean nothing

Then tell me why can't you just leave them alone



So tell me how can you

Expect me to be true

While you're playing silly games with my heart

Darlin' I won't accept you

Putting blame on me

You know that I'm the innocent one



Now haven't I been faithful

Haven't I been true

But you're not even grateful

Ooh, what's a girl to do







Girl, I'm giving all I have

Just to prove my love is cool



Boy, I'm giving all my love

So that you will know my love is true



Now haven't I been faithful

Haven't I been true

But you're not even grateful

Ooh, what's a girl to do (what's a guy to do)



Now haven't I been faithful

Haven't I been true

But you're not even grateful

Ooh, what's a girl to do (what's a guy gonna do)



Now haven't I been faithful

Haven't I been true

But you're not even grateful

Ooh, what's a girl to do (what is a guy to do)


We go through changes

Time after time

I guess that's just life

Feelings we can't express

We only hide

Deep down inside



Who needs another sad affair

Girl, if we care

We'll end it right here

We could be lovers

If we'd only share

All that we feel

But we must be sincere



I know we've been

Been here so many times before

But don't you think

Think that our love's worth fighting for



If we try

Just one time, oh baby

If we try

Then I'll know we'll get by



Our love is gentle

It's give and take

It's all abput the vows we make

Whether we honor them

With love and trust

It's all up to us



Who needs another sad affair

Girl, if we care

We'll end it right here

We could be lovers

If we'd only share

All that we feel

But we must be sincere



I know we've been

Been here so many times before

But don't you think

Think that our love's worth fighting for






You're so in love

And that's nice

Just have fun

Living your life

He likes to kiss you

And that's cool

And that's the kind of thing that

Puppy lovers should do



But all your friends are saying

It's a matter of time

Before your Prince Charming

Hits you with the famous line

And all your friends are wondering

Just what you're gonna do

They say that if you do it

They'll have to trust you



But you don't want to do

The things they tell you to

It's not your personality

It's not the way you wanna be

And if he treasures you

Then he won't pressure you

Their faith is more than one thing

Left to decide



Take your time (take your time)

It's alright

You love your body

You wanna do right

Take your time

It's your life

Don't let nobody

Tell you that you're not right

Take your time (take your time)

It's alright

You love your body

You wanna do right

Take your time

It's your life

Don't let nobody

Tell you that you're not right



Your first time love

Hey that's cool

It's wonderful when love is innocent too

Like holding hands

And walking through the park

It's a special kind of love

What puppy lovers are



But all your friends are saying

That you're running out of time

They say that if you cherish him

You'll change your frame of mind

And all your friends are telling you

That if you're love is true

They say that you should do it

He'll forever cherish you



But you don't want to do

The things they tell you to

It's not your personality

It's not the way you wanna be

And if he treasures you

Then he won't pressure you

Their faith is more than one thing

Left to decide







But you don't want to do

The things they tell you to

It's not your personality

It's not the way you wanna be

And if he treasures you

Then he won't pressure you

Their faith is more than one thing

Left to decide






Calling all cars 



I never thought that

I could feel this way

You came around and

Brought about a change in me



I was a typical guy

You came along and blew my mind

You were runnin' fast

I was runnin' slow

Everybody said that it would not work

Love came and set me free

You were standing there to rescue me

Love caught it, we thought

Why can't we be in love, well



Why, it's no crime

If I'm guilty of love

Let me do my time

Why, it's no crime

Everybody needs love

And baby (so do I)



You never thought love

Came so easily

No doubt about it

Never in your dreams, no way



You were a typical girl

You came along and changed my world

I walk slow

You walk fast

Everybody said that it could not last

Love came inside of me

Never knew how good our love could be

Love caught it, we thought

Why can't we be in love, well







I've spent half a lifetime

Waiting for someone

You say I know it was you

They don't recommend it

I don't understand it

I've been reprimanded

'Cause I'm in love with you



Calling all cars 



You were a typical girl

You came along and changed my world

I walk slow

You walk fast

Everybody said that it could not last

Love came inside of me

Never knew how good our love could be

Love caught it, we thought

Why can't we be in love, well



Why, why



So do I, so do I

So do I, so do I

Oh so do I







Why


Feels good, everybody

Tender lover, tender love



Eleanor Rigby

Spends half her life all alone

No fault of her own

Made a decision

Love has no place in her home

Love it has a right to go



Love has no limit

If you believe in love

It'll open up so

Don't even give in

'Cause if it starts to give

Just hold on

We didn't didn't make it

But love'll get you by

If you only try

Just don't give up on love

'Cause it didn't work out this time



Tender lover, girl, I'm so sorry

Well I never meant to hurt you

I never meant to break your heart

Tender love, so broken hearted

Well I never meant to break your

Break your little tender heart



Don't ever give up

In spite of our love

Love is much too precious

It's greater than both of us

There's more than enough

Keep lookin' for love

Just be a believer

It'll give you what you want



Sky is the limit

If you believe in love

It'll open up so

Don't ever give in

'Cause if it starts to give

Just hold on

We didn't didn't make it

But love'll get you by

If you only try

Just don't give up on love

'Cause it didn't work out this time







My tender lover



Tender lover, tender love

Tender lover, tender love



Love has no limit

If you believe in love

It'll open up so

Don't even give in

'Cause if it starts to give

Just hold on

We didn't didn't make it

But love'll get you by

If you only try

Just don't give up on love

'Cause it didn't work out this time

Hey....ohhh...

You drive a pretty car - you know how fine you are

And nobody needs to say it.. no way..

They love the clothes you wear - they compliment you and I

Just love the way you play it...



But the only thing you dream of - money can't buy for you..

Ohh..

And in my dreams I make your wish come true 



For the girl who has everything 

I bring you love

Cause the girl who has everything can't get enough

Of my love

Why must you always fake it? (oh yeah..)

Girl you need to understand

Your heart is safe within my hands and

I promise I'll never break it...ohh..

Ohhh..yeah..
Can this be true?
Tell me, can this be real?
How can I put into words what I feel?
My life was complete
I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?
I never thought that love could feel like this
and you've changed my world with just one kiss.
How can it be that right here with me
there's an angel?
It's a miracle...

Your love is like a river
Peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret
That I never could keep
When I look into your eyes
I know that it's true
God must have spent...
A little more time
On you...
(A little more time, yes he did baby)

In all of creation
All things great and small
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than
Any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold
When you came in this world
And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without
The warmth of your smile
The heart of a child
That's deep inside
Leaves me purified

Your love is like a river
Peaceful and deep (and deep)
Your soul is like a secret
That I never could keep
When I look into your eyes
I know that it's true
God must have spent...
A little more time
On you...
(on you, on you, on you, you....on you, on you, on you, you..) ohhh...
(on you, on you, on you, you....on you, on you, on you, you..) yeah...

Never thought that love could feel like this

You sheltered me from harm.

You kept me warm

You kept me warm 

And you gave my life to me

You set me free, 

You set me free 

The finest years I ever knew 

Were all the years I had with you 



I would give everything I own, 

I'd give up my life, my heart, my home.

And I would give everything I own, 

Just to have you back again. 



You taught me how to laugh, 

What a time

What a time

You never said too much,

But still you showed you cared,

And I knew from watching you. 



And nobody else could ever know

The part of me that can't let go. 



I would give everything I own, 

I'd give up my life, my heart, my home.

And I would give everything I own, 

Just to have you back again. 



Is there someone you know,

Loving them so,

You're taking them all for granted.

You may lose them one day, 

Someone takes them away, 

And they don't hear the words 

You long to say



Give up my life, give up my heart

Everything I own 



You know baby, my love for you will

always stay true. That's right. 'Cause

there is no me without you. (And I would give everything)

Everything I own Nobody can love you, love you 

Love you, love you like I do



I would give everything I own, 

I'd give up my life, my heart, my home.

And I would give everything I own, 

Just to have you back again. 



Just to have you back again.


ooooh....
Lying in your arms
So close together
Didn't know just what I had
Now I toss and turn
Cause I'm without you 
How I'm missing you so bad
Where was my head?
Where was my heart?
Now I cry alone in the dark 
I lie awake
I drive myself crazy 
Drive myself crazy
Thinking of you
Made a mistake
When I let you go baby 
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do (wanting you the way that I do)

I was such a fool
I couldn't see it
Just how good you were to me (Just how good you were to me)

You confessed your love ( You confessed your love)
Undying devotion
I confessed my need to be free
And now I'm left
With all this pain 
I've only got myself to blame

I lie awake
I drive myself crazy 
Drive myself crazy
Thinking of you
Made a mistake
When I let you go baby 
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do (wanting you the way that I do)

Why didn't I know it
(How much I loved you baby)
Why couldn't show it
(If I had only told you)
When I had the chance
Oh I had the chance

Miss Thang.. (oohh)



Miss Thang.. (Ooh ahh ooh..)

Miss Thang.. (Oh yeah..)





Couldn't wait to understand

I grew up faster than the rest

It affected the ways of my attitude

But don't take it as I'm rude



Now I'm fly as I can be

Got responsibilities

But I know when I'm right I'm right

And when I'm wrong as I can be



But it's all right for me to think it's all about me

Too many people tryin' to check, but they can't see

I know you wouldn't want to think that I'm nieve

Said I may be young, but I'm experienced

In all I need to know, that's why I'm 



Miss Thang (Because I know I've got it goin' on, they call me..)

Miss Thang (Miss Thang, yeah..)

Miss Thang (It's the way that I carry on, that I'm Miss Thang...)

Miss Thang (Miss Thang, baby..)





I meet guys that are my age, but they can't relate to me

Because I'm too much for their minds, and their young mentality

Confidence is what you bold

And my friends are much too old

But I swing out when they swang

And that's how I got my name



But it's all right for me to think it's all about me

Too many people tryin' to check but they can't see

I know you wouldn't wanna think that I'm nieve

Said I may be young, but I'm experienced

In all I need to know, that's why I'm...



Miss Thang (Because I know I got it goin' on, they call me..)

Miss Thang (Miss Thang, yeah...)

Miss Thang (It's the way that I carry on, that I'm Miss Thang

Miss Thang (Miss Thaaaang...)



Miss Thang (Don't you know I got it goin' on)

Live and learn from fools and from sages

Floatin' down stream and 

Losin' touch with all that is real. 

Whole earth lover, keepin' under cover 

Never knowin' where ya been.

Well you've always got your tail on the wag. 

Shootin' fire from your mouth just like a dragon. 

You act like a perpertual drag. 

You better check it out, 

Or someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon. 



It ain't easy, livin' like ya wanna, 

And it's so hard to find piece of mind. Yes it is. 

The way I see it, you've got to say shit. 

But don't forget to drop me a line. 



Said you're as bald as an egg at eighteen. 

And workin' for you dad is just a drag. 

He still stuffs your mouth with your dreams. 

You better check it out, 

Or someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon. 



Keepin' touch with Mama Kin. 

Tell her where you've gone and been. 

Livin' out your fantasy, 

Sleeping late and smoking tea.

she good, she good to me 

I love her 

well I've been so many places 

hidin' from the wind and the rain 

but you could write me a letter 

for to save me from a-goin' insane


we all live on the edge of town 

where we all live ain't a soul around 

people start a-comin', all we do is just a-grin 

said we gotta move out cause the city's movin' in 

I said we gotta move out cause the city's movin' in 

tell me who ya know, and I'll tell ya who too 

go see my friend and he'll set you free 

tell me what you need and maybe I can go too 

no one knows the way but maybe me 

nobody goes there, nobody shows where 

nobody knows where you can find me 

good morning glory, halleluh to ya 

what is the story and what's been goin' through ya? 

livin' like a king off the fat of the land 

workin' like a dog in a rock n' roll band 

we're movin' -- we're gettin' out 

we're movin' -- without a doubt 

we're movin' -- we're goin' far 

we're movin' -- oh yes we are 







level with God and you're in tune with the universe 

talk with yourself and you'll hear what you wanna know 

gotta rise above cause below it's only gettin' worse 

life in time will take you where you wanna go, where you wanna go, 

x's a bunch 

baby catch ya round, I don't know where I'm goin'


walkin' the dog 

I'm just a-walkin' your dog 

well if you don't know how to do it 

I'll show you how to walk the dog 

ask your mama for fifteen cents 

to see the elephant jump the fence 

it jumped so high, it touched the sky 

didn't come back till the fourth of July 

mary mary, quite contrary 

how does your garden grow 

well well, silver bells, and little bitty bitty white shells 

pretty maids all in a row


get yourself cooler, lay yourself low 

coincidental murder, with nothing to show 

with the judge, constipation will go to his head 

and his wife's aggravation, you're soon enough dead 



it's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend 

it's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend 



gotcha with the cocaine they found with your gun 

 

no smoothy face laywer to getcha undone 

say love ain't the same on the south side of town 

you could look, but you ain't gonna find it around 



it's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend 

it's the same old story, same old story 

same old song and dance 



fate comes a-knockin', doors start lockin' 

your old time connection, change your direction 

ain't gonna change it, can't rearrange it 

can't stand the pain when it's all the same to you, my friend 



when you're low down and dirty, from walkin' the street 

with your old hurdy-gurdy, no one to meet 

say love ain't the same, on the south side of town 

you could look, but you ain't gonna find it around


Down to who knows who, just to socialize. 

I'm waiting for my girls, when you call my eyes. 

You got no way to make a man honey, 

You got to understand. 

I'm your man, child. Lord of the Thighs. 



Well, well, Lordie my God, 

What do we got here? 

She's flashin' 'cross the floor, 

Make it perfectly clear. 

You're the bait, and you're the hook, 

Someone 'bound to take a look. 

I'm your man, child. Lord of the Thighs. 



You must of come here to find it, 

You've got the look in your eyes. 

Although you really don't mind it - 

I am the Lord of your Thighs! 



You must of come here to find it baby, 

You've got the look in your eyes. 

Although you really don't mind it - 

I am the Lord of your Thighs!


>> cinderella

Workin' this job ain't payin' the bills
Sick and tired rat race takin' my thrills
Kickin' down the road not a dime in my pocket
Nightime falls and I'm ready to rock it


I need a shot of gasoline
I'm hittin' one sixteen
I get so hot I see steam
Forget the day 'cause we're gonna scream
Night songs
Howl into the light singin'
Night songs
Makes the day right
Night songs
Raise your glass take a bite
Night songs

Ridin' to the east and ridin' to the west
Sleepin' all day but never get a rest
Lookin' at the time stand still it ain't right
Livin' for the moment time to get it tight



I need a shot of gasoline
I'm hittin' one sixteen
I get so hot I see steam
Forget the day 'cause we're gonna scream

Night songs 


All right yea
I met this girl around quarter to ten
We made it once she said "make me again"
She wrapped her love around me all night long
In the mornin' we were still goin' strong 

Now let me tell ya it sure feels good
First time I saw that girl I knew it would
Now let me tell ya it sure felt right
No pullin' teeth she didn't want to fight she said 

Shake me
All night 
She said
Shake me
Shake it don't break it baby
Shake me
All night
She said
All night long
All night long baby 

Screamed and scratched and rolled out of the bed
I never really got her out of my head
And now and then she makes those social calls
Gives me a squeeze gets me kickin' the walls 

Now let me tell ya it still feels tight
And we were shakin' after every bite
I feel her comin' in the middle of the night
screamin' higher 

Shake me
All night 
She said
Shake me
Shake it don't break it baby
Shake me
All night
She said
Shake me
ooo yea

All night, keep the fire burnin' cause we're doin' all right
All night, come on and shake it right 

Shake me
Shake me
Shake me
Shake me
Shake me
All night 
She said
Shake me
Shake it don't break it baby
Shake me
All night
She said
Shake me
ooo yea 

Shake me
Shake me
Shake me
Shake me


I count the falling tears
They fall before my eyes
Seems like a thousand years
Since we broke the ties
I call you on the phone
But never get a rise
So sit there all alone
It's time you realize

I'm not your fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's foooool
I'm no fooool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
Never again no no

You take your road I'll take mine,
The paths have both been beaten
Searchin' for a change of pace
Life needs to be sweetened
I scream my heart out just to make a dime
And with that dime I bought your love
But now I've changed my mind

I'm not your fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
I'm no fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
Never again no no

I count the falling tears
They fall before my eyes
Seems like a thousand years
since we broke the ties

I'm not your fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
I'm no fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
I'm not your fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
I'm no fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool

Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool


When you see your face in the mirror
Does it seem the end is gettin' nearer
All your life you spent as a wheeler
Now the hole you dug, it gettin' deeper

You're talkin' words
But they don't make the rhyme
You'll lose it all
Cause you can't draw the line

You got nothin'
Nothin' for nothin'
You're hurtin' overtime
Nothin' for nothin'
And we don't need your kind
Nothin' for nothin'
Pushin', shovin', got no time
Nothin' for nothin'

When you see the day gettin' darker
You can run to yuor lies, run to your cover
When you feel the heat from a lover
You hit the highway lookin' for another

You made the grade
You left the hills behind
You take the the cake and eat it
You're so blind

You got nothin'
Nothin' for nothin'
You're hurtin' overtime
Nothin' for nothin'
And we don't need your kind
Nothin' for nothin'
Pushin', shovin', got no time
Nothin' for nothin', hey

Nothin' for nothin'
You're hurtin' overtime
Nothin' for nothin'
And we don't need your kind
Nothin' for nothin'
Pushin', shovin', got no time
Nothin' for nothin', hey

Nothin' for nothin'
You're hurtin' overtime
Nothin' for nothin'
And we don't need your kind
Nothin' for nothin'
Pushin', shovin', got no time
Nothin' for nothin', hey

Nothin' for nothin'
You're hurtin' overtime
Nothin' for nothin'
And we don't need your kind
Nothin' for nothin'
Pushin', shovin', got no time
Hey
You're hurtin' overtime


See me, feel me, come and touch me
The way I touch you
In the crossfire, live wire
Who said maybe
I said maybe won't do

The sands of time are slipping by
Dust to dust, no second try

You're only goin'
Once around the ride, yea
You're only goin'
Once around the ride

Rock hard, got an ace card
I ain't crazy
Just got nothin' to do
Day breaks, I'll take
Can't wait forever
Cause my life will be through

The sands of time are slipping by
Dust to dust, no second try

You're only goin'
Once around the ride, yea
You're only goin'
Once around the ride

Dust to dust, no second try
You're only goin'
Once around the ride
Once around the ride
Once around the ride
Once around the ride
Once around the ride
Once around the ride
Once around the ride


We hang tough
When the chips are low
Can't buy enough
So we steal the show
We get so hot
We can't cool down
So the hell with that
We're rippin' through your town

We've had enough of the raw deals
Hit the road and tell ya how it feels

Like hell on wheels
Like hell on wheels
Like hell on wheels
Like hell on wheels

We live fast
But we love it so
Can't see the past
But it's gone we know
We get so hot
We can't cool down
So the hell with that
We're burnin' through your town

We've had enough of the raw deals
Hit the road and tell ya how it feels

Like hell on wheels
Like hell on wheels
Like hell on wheels
Like hell on wheels
Run like hell

Hell on wheels
Like hell on wheels
Like hell on wheels
Like hell on wheels
Like hell on wheels
Like hell on wheels
Like hell on wheels
Like hell on wheels


When I was a young boy
they said you're only gettin' older
but how was I to know then
that they'd be cryin' on my shoulder
put your money in a big house
get yourself a pretty wife
She'll collect your life insurance
when she connects you with a knife

Somebody get the doctor,
I'm feelin' pretty poor,
somebody get the stretcher
before I hit the floor

Somebody save me

I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree,

Somebody save me

save me

Everybody's got opinions
but nobody's got the answers
and the shit you ate for breakfast
well it'll only give ya cancer
We're runnin' in a circle
runnin' to the mornin' light
and if ya ain't quite workable
It's been one hell of a night

Somebody get the doctor,
I think I'm gonna crash
Never paid the bill
because I ain't got the cash

Somebody save me

I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree,

Somebody save me

save me, look out

Save me

I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree,

Somebody save me

Save me

Somebody save me

I'm goin' down for the last time, look out

Save me

Save me



I've been loved and I've been shoved
Beaten every step of the way
Lived by the glass
And got a little ass
Three or four times a day

Well, I've seen blood like Noah's flood
I think its gonna take us away
Tellin' you should listen real good
Hell's come back to stay

Well you can't take it with you
It's a one way ride
Baby's had enough of lookin'

In from the outside
In from the outside

Feelin' down low, time to let go
You're only as good as you please
Walk before you crawl, make the last call
You need it like a social disease

Well you can't take it with you
It's a one way ride
Baby's had enough of lookin'

In from the outside
In from the outside
In from the outside

I've been loved and I've been shoved
Beaten every step of the way
Lived by the glass
And got a little ass
Three or four times a day

Well you can't take it with you
It's a one way ride
Baby's had enough of lookin'

In from the outside
In from the outside
In from the outside


I'm gettin' hot
I've got to give a shot
She wants it all
And that's a lot

I'm gettin' ready
The love's lookin' steady
It's gettin' sticky
I thought she might miss me
She looked at me and said

I need a little
Push, push
Gonna give a little
Push, push
If ya take a little
Push, push
Then you'll get a little
Push, push

She's lookin' fine
Flashin' like a neon sign
She thinks it's love
I said that comes with time

I'm gettin' ready
The love's lookin' steady
It's gettin' sticky
I thought she might miss me
She looked at me and said

I need a little
Push, push
Come and give a little
Push, push
If ya take a little
Push, push
Then you'll get a little
Push, push
Whoa, yea
Push on

I'm gettin' ready
The love's lookin' steady
It's gettin' sticky
I thought she might miss me
She looked at me and said

I need a little
Push, push
Come and give a little
Push, push
If ya take a little
Push, push
Then you'll get a little
Push, push

Woo, push, push
Mmm, keep pushin' me
Push, push
Push on
Push, push
Ooo, yea, yea
Push, push


I hit the road wide open at seventeen
Mama cried herself to sleep
Lost a dad I'd never seen
Took all my childhood friends
Guitar, and a dream
Some say I got it bad
I say I've got the cream

No, no, no
I roll into town and I'm spinnin' my wheels to black
Go, go, go
I hit the stage and you make me feel like I'm back

I'm back
Back home again
I'm back
Back home again
I'm back
Back home

I worked from nine to five at twenty-two
Felt good to stay alive
Good times were far and few

Trustin' my hopes and dreams
With someone who said they knew
Just how to make ends meet
They haven't got a clue

No, no, no
I rolled into town and I'm spinnin' my wheels to black
Go, go, go
I hit the stage and you make me feel like I'm back

I'm back
Back home again
I'm back
Back home again
I'm back
Back home again
I'm back
Back home
Take me back

I'm back
I'm back
Back home again
I'm back
Back home again
I'm back
Back home again
I'm back
Back home


>> damnyankees

Dressed to kill and lookin' dynomite,
with her high-laced stockings and her sweater so tight.
I asked her her name, she said her name was "Maybe."

Well she walked up to me, and she asked me to chance
I said, "I am lookin' for some wild romance,"
She gave me a wink--she said I should think about it, maybe

She said, "What you got babe, is what I need.
Your kind of love got me on my knees."
I'm so tied up
What you got got a hold on me, your kind of love make a man outta me
I'm so tied up, you got me so fired up

Little sister, hits the stage
She can't help it, she's comin' of age
Little junior, he's all in a rage
Did you notice she was comin' of age

If looks could kill, I'd be dead on the floor
You got me all tied up, honey, beggin' for more
Somebody call a doctor, I think I'm goin' crazy

(Because) What you got, babe, is what I need
Your kind of love got me on my knees
I'm so tied up
What you got got a hold on me
Your kind of love make a man outta me

When you wake up in the morning, and you're lyin' in my bed
Do you think of me, how I made you scream
It was an all night love affair (are you ready, I'm ready)
Say "Mary go 'round again"
Would a lollipop get ya back on top from the candy man, yeah friend?
Got a hunger for affection, I just can't get enough
Well I read you, baby, like an open book
Now the doctor's in, let me take a look
Say yeah, yeah, s'alright

I got a bad, bad reputation 
(I got) a bad, bad reputation

When you step into the spotlight, you're a cherry red machine
(wanna touch you, wanna taste you)
Wanna kiss you in between
You legs say action, your body built for speed
I know what I do for you, won't you do the same for me

Did I mention my intentions?
I just can't get enough
You can huff and puff, try to blow me down
But the big bad wolf is back in town 
Say yeah, yeah, I'll bite

I got a bad, bad reputation 
A bad, bad reputation

Ever heard the story (said it's true)
'Bout a travellin' man (he'd been around)
He could have any woman (welcome to)
Palm of his hand (blow ya down)
She could never fight it (no she won't)
'Cause you know she needs it so bad, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Bad, bad reputation
Bad, bad reputation
Bad, bad reputation


(Everyone needs a place to run away, run away)

Summer night, moonlit sky
Tearing pages from a magazine, she cries
"I don't wanna be the lonely one tonight."
She said, I came to this place, full of dreams
Young and innocent and only 16
Now I wonder if it's too late to turn back.

So she runs, and she hides, and she dries the tears from
her eyes
And the night goes on, and on, and on

She's in the twilight zone (twilight zone)
Yeah, you gotta run, run, run away
It's such a long way home
When it hurts so bad you gotta run, run, run away

Perfect day, feels like Spring
Can see forever but you can't see anything
Now I wonder why they call it "paradise"

It's a crime, it's a shame
And they won't remember your name
And your life goes on, and on, and on

It's like the twilight zone (twilight zone)
Yeah, you gotta run, run, run away
But she won't go home 
So she's gotta run, run, run away

She came from a small town
So tired of getting pushed around
In the dark of the night, no one around
She'll run from this shabby town, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's a laugh, it's a game
Don't you let it drive you insane 
Cause your life goes on, and on, and on....

It's like the twilight zone (twilight zone)
Yeah, you gotta run, run, run away
But she won't go home 
When it hurts so bad you gotta run, run, run away

She's in the twilight zone (twilight zone)
Yeah, you gotta run, run, run away
It's such a long way home
When it hurts so bad you gotta run, run, run away


I don't wanna hear about it anymore
It's a shame I've got to live without you anymore
There's a fire in my heart
A pounding in my brain
It's driving me crazy

We don't need to talk about it anymore
Yesterday's just a memory
Can we close the door

I just made one mistake
I didn't know what to say
When you called me baby

Don't say goodnight
Say you're gonna stay forever
Oh, whoa, all the way

Can you take me high enough
To fly me over (fly me over) yesterday
Can you take me high enough
It's never over
Yesterday's just a memory 
(Yesterday's just a memory and)

I don't want to live without you anymore
Can't you see I'm in misery
And you know for sure
I would live and die for you
And I'd know just what to do when you call me baby

Don't say goodbye
Say you're gonna stay forever
Oh, whoa, all the way

Can you take me high enough
Can you fly me over (fly me over) yesterday
Can you take me high enough
It's never over
Yesterday's just a memory

I'm running
I was running for the door
The next thing I remember
I was running back for more, yeah

Don't say goodbye
Say you're gonna stay forever
Oh, whoa, all the way (all the way, all the way, yeah)

Can you take me high enough
Can you fly me over (fly me over) yesterday
Can you take me high enough
It's never over, whoa, whoa, whoa

Can you take me high enough
Won't you fly me over (won't you fly me over) yesterday
Can you take me high enough
It's never over, whoa, whoa, whoa


Hey brother, ready for another
Dose of my Yankee Pride
In the jungle you just might stumble
On to something that you never tried
Got that right

There was trouble in the east, worry in the west
Till the wall came tumblin' down
Shift in the sand, rockets to the madman
Haven't heard a sound

You don't have to worry, help is on the way
We don't need no, "Thank you, ma'am"
We know what they're gonna say

(They say)
Hey, hey, damn Yankee
Woh, oh, oh, damn Yankee
(How we doin')

Now I say what I want and I do what I want
And I go where I want to go
Ain't no strong man, safe from the hang man
Baby, now don't ya know

If you need assistance, I'll be on the way
You run into a little resistance
You know what they're gonna say

(They say)
Hey, hey, damn Yankee
Woh, oh, oh, damn Yankee
Hey, hey, damn Yankee

They landed at Plymouth Rock, the kids was ready to roll
Greasy dictator down south of us, lost all control
He didn't have time to see me, he didn't have time to thank me
Suck on the barrel of my hot shotgun
Smile when you say, "Damn Yankee"

Hey, hey, damn Yankee
Woh, oh, oh, damn Yankee
Hey, hey, damn Yankee
Woh, oh, oh, damn Yankee
Damn Yankee, damn Yankee


I was a loner crusin' with the wind
I wasn't lookin' when you pulled me in
I had to leave you like I always did
You knew damn well I'd come again

Now I'm falling where I've never been
My resistance is wearing thin
Somewhere in the distance
like a long lost friend
Whoa oh oh oh, yeah--
Lord, here I come again
Come again

Yeah
Been so long since I've seen you girl
Swear I've been around the world
Every room is an empty space
In the darkness I see your face
Whoa Whoa Whoa 
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Whoa Whoa Whoa

When I finally get my hands on you
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Lay you down, strip you bare
Make love to you till the morning comes around

I wasn't lookin' when you pulled me in
Whoa oh oh oh
Yeah--
Lord, here I come again
Come again
Come again
I said Lord 

I wasn't lookin' when you pulled me in
Whoa oh oh oh
Yeah--

I wasn't lookin' when you pulled me in
Whoa oh oh oh

You don't have to love me baby
I don't give a damn
You've got the time I've got the touch
And you know who I am

It's simplified, I'm mystified
A case of hit and run
Ain't no use no more abuse
You are my number one
And I'm in love
I'm mystified, baby
Yeah, I'm in love

You're my kind of lover
You always keep me mystified

I'm in love
And I'm mystified, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now
You're my kind of lover
You always keep me mystified

Well I get out of the kitchen
When I can't take the heat
What you've got cooking, hun
It's good enough to eat
Well, in walked the boss man
With a boom, boom, boom
He said, "Break time's over, boy,
Get back to pushin' that broom."

Well, that's the way it goes sometimes
He said "sweep!"
It's the story of my life
Whoa oh yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah now
You're my kind of lover (you're my kind of lover)
You always keep me mystified
You just keep it comin', babe
You always wanna keep me satisfied
You're my kind of lover (you're my kind of lover)
You always keep me mystified

Whoa oh oh oh

I don't mind pushing that broom baby
Long as I'm pushin' back towards you

You always keep me mystified
Yeah, you're my kind of lover, baby (you're my kind of lover)
You always wanna keep me satisfied
You're my kind of lover (you're my kind of)
Woah, oh--
You know you keep me mystified


Here comes the night time
And it's knockin' at my door
Lady luck, she's come around
And she wants a little more

Down on the boulevard
They're screamin' like a child
"If I can't play that mean guitar
It's gonna drive me wild, wild"

Rock City, here I come
Rock City, here I come
Rock City, U.S.A.

The sidewalk's moving
The palm trees sway
The switchblade girls line 'em up in L.A.
Everybody came here from somewhere to play
They wear their guitars low just like Jimmy Page

Well, I've been to London
I've been to France
I've been to Mississippi
Where they taught me to dance

Lord, have mercy, I ain't never seen
Nobody going down like this beauty queen

Rock City, here I come
Rock City, here I come
Rock City, U.S.A.
Rock City, here I come
Rock City, here I come
Rock City, U.S.A.

(I'm on fire)
(I'm on fire)
I'm on fire
(I'm on fire)
Just can't get enough (I'm on fire)
You can't stop me now (I'm on fire)
You can't hold me down (I'm on fire)
I said come on, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can't stop rockin'
Can't stop rockin'
Can't stop rockin'
Can't stop rockin'
Can't stop rockin'

Hey yeah!
Look out, I'm a man with a mission
Tell you what I wanna do
We've gotta move, we don't need no permission
Just need me and you
And you ought to know
If there's a way, I will come crashing through your door, mmm-hmm
I'll take you higher than you've ever been before
So come on won't you

Tell me how you want it
Tell me what you want me to do

Another nasty situation (c'mon baby)
I heard that story line before (oh, hey)
We're gonna rock this fuckin' nation (oh! ow! yeah!)

I was cruizin' backstage in Des Moines, Iowa
And a little girl comes up next to me and says
"Mr. Nugent do you think my skirt is short enough?"
I said, "Baby, you want to be alive you've got to piledrive!"

Did anybody get the license plate number of that truck?


Piledriver

Yes I am

You're always pretending to be 

Someone who prefers to be free

You think you can fool me with your lyin' eyes

But what is this game that you play

When all that your trying to say

Is that your lonely, in need of a friend



Oh yeah sorrow woman, I just can't seem to get to you

Oh yeah sorrow woman, if only you could see you as I do



And can't you see that it's true

There's someone as lonely as you

Trying so hard, so hard to get through

And why can't everyone see the way that it really should be

Why hide your feelings and suffer the pain



Oh yeah, sorrow woman, I just can't seem to get to you

Oh yeah, sorrow woman, if only you could see you as I do



You know that sorrow is a woman

You know she'll make you feel sad

You know that sorrow is a woman



Oh yeah, sorrow woman, I just can't seem to get to you

Oh yeah, sorrow woman, if only you could see you as I do


Who's the one to knock me over 

Who's the one to take me by surprise 

Who's the one who's out to get me 

Who will share my fantasy tonight 



It could be you, it could be me 

It could be anyone 

It could be you, it could be me 

It could be you, it could be anyone 



Do you really know the story? 

Have you really come to see the band? 

Can you reach out for the glory? 

Can you feel the nearness of my hand? 



It could be you, it could be me 

It could be anyone 



If you look a little harder 

You can see we're really all the same 

And if you look a little deeper 

Can't you see it's really all a game? 



It could be you, it could be me 

It could be anyone 

It could be you, it could be me 

It could be you, it could be anyone


Midnight, bright light, shining from the sky 

Circulating round the earth, trying to catch your eye

Lowdown, showdown, trying to break away

Stay on course, feel the force, careful what you say



Ooh yeah, ooh yeah can't you feel that it's real?

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah set your sights on the satellite



Me and you, rendezvous, we've got to take the chance

I'm paralyzed, I'm hypnotized, I'm in some kinda trance

Hazy, crazy, this thing's lost control

It's got the power, it's got the strength to steal away your soul



Ooh yeah, ooh yeah can't you feel that it's real?

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah set your sights on the satellite



It's burning up the sky

It's burning up the sky

Yes it's burning, yes it's burning

Can't you see that it's burning



Can't you see that it's burning

It's burning up the sky

Can't you see that it's burning



Midnight, bright light, shining from the sky

Circulating round the earth, trying to catch your eye

Lowdown, showdown, trying to break away

Stay on course feel the force, careful what you say



Ooh yeah, ooh yeah can't you feel that it's real?

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah set your sights on the satellite


On the first day of the first month in some distant year 

The whole sky froze golden 

Some said it was the aftermath of the radium bomb 

While others told of a final retribution 

A terrible revenge of the gods 



But we understood the grand finale 

Fulfillment of a prophecy told many years before 

So all that was left was... 



All the women were captured and chained 

And national suicide was proclaimed 

And New America fell to the ground 

And all the children lay crippled and lame 

But all the nations came together 

In fear of the thought of the end 

No more would we fight in the streets 

No courage had we to defend 



When the walls came tumbling down 

When the walls came tumbling down 

Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound 

When the walls came tumbling down 

When the walls came tumbling down 

When the walls came tumbling down 

Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound 



A blinding light the sun had died 

A new moon took its place 

Tidal waves and open graves the fate of the unhuman race 

The city's heart no longer beats no pity have I left to lend 

A sinner sits reciting Dylan it's now that I welcome the end 



When the walls came tumbling down 

When the walls came tumbling down 

When the walls came tumbling down 

Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound 

When the walls came tumbling down 

When the walls came tumbling down 

When the walls came tumbling down 

Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound 



When the walls came tumbling down 

When the walls came tumbling down 

When the walls came tumbling down 

Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound 

When the walls came tumbling down 

When the walls came tumbling down 

When the walls came tumbling down 

Nobody made a sound 

Down


Well I've been lying awake all night just thinking of you 

But a bottle of whiskey lies heavy obstructing my view 

I've got a bottle of pills to give me my thrills 

And I know that I'm leading a life that kills 



Wasted - I've wasted my time 

Wasted - I'm shooting a line 

Wasted - I'm stuck in a hole 

Wasted - I'm losing control 



And I've been meaning to call, I've been wanting to phone 

You see I don't like the thought of leaving you here alone 

Well I've seen things down here that are fit for a queen 

I've seen things down here that should never be seen 



Wasted - I've wasted my money 

Wasted - I've wasted you honey 

Wasted - I'm out of my brain 

Wasted - I'm going insane 



I'm running in thin air 

There's nothingness everywhere 

I've gotta get out, oh won't you help me? 

I've gotta get out, oh won't you help me? 

I've gotta get out, oh won't you help me get out? 



I thought I saw you just the other day 

But it couldn't be you 'cos you had nothing to say 

'He's going away', they told all my friends 

Well now I'll be stuck in here til the misery ends 



Wasted - I've wasted my time 

Wasted - I'm shooting a line 

Wasted - I'm out of my head 

Wasted - I wish I was dead


Well, we were gettin' ready just the other night 

When a knock on the dressing room door 

Gave way to a leather jacket little girl 

Who we'd never ever seen before 

In her red satin dress and her high heeled shoes 

She took us all by surprise 

And when she asked us what we wanted to do 

Well, she said it with her eyes 

Just getcha rocks off 



When we finally took the stage there she was 

But she wasn't on her own 

'Cause she'd brought some friends maybe 5 or 6 

Yeah, she must have been on the phone 

And when they started dancing and jumping around 

Well we couldn't believe our eyes 

'Cause they'd got the whole damn audience rockin' 

And they'd got us paralyzed 

Just getcha rocks off


Now in your big flash motor and your wild reputation 

You're ready to hit the streets 

Winking at the boys, yeah heading for the noise 

Got the world at your feet 

If leaving me for dead with a pistol at my head 

Is your idea of how I'd feel 

Well let me tell you honey 'fore you spend all of your money 

I got my hands firmly on the wheel, yeah 



It don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter to me 

It don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter to me 



Back street lover in the cold of the evening 

Takes you to a place he knows 

Says it will be fine better make up your mind 

You've cut it deep and now it shows 

It's way past midnight and you travel through the city 

You wonder what you should do 

Well baby can't you see that you've had enough of me 

And I've certainly had enough of you 



It don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter to me 

It don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter to me 



It don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter to me 

It don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter to me 

It don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter to me 

It don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter to me 



It doesn't matter 

It doesn't matter 

It doesn't matter

Magic mirror please tell is this heaven or hell?

Well, I found a new way
Not the way the old folks tried
Well, I'm pushing harder
Got my sights set for the sky

I live my life on the run
I do my time on my own
If you get too close
You can steal my heart

So you want me back now
Sorry, baby, I can't stay
You had your chance, girl
But you threw it threw it away

I tried to make you mine
You wouldn't give me the time
I don't want to feel that pain any more

The last time, the last time, the last time I fall
The last time, the last time, the last time I fall

Well I'm on my way
I've got no time to lose today
I tried to make you mine
You wouldn't give me the time
I don't want to feel that pain any more
Pain any more

The last time, the last time, the last time I fall
The last time, the last time, the last time I fall
The last time, the last time, the last time I fall
The last time, the last time, the last time I fall
The last time, the last time, the last time I fall
The last time, the last time, the last time I fall
The last time, the last time, the last time
The last time, it's the last time that I'll fall

I can take you up
I can tear you down
I'm a heat wave coming at you
Taking what I please
Falling on your knees
You need me, yes, you do

From the moment I take over
You're going to call me back for more

Down on your knees, down on your knees, down on your knees
Down on your knees, down on your knees, down on your knees

Knocking down your door
Pull you to the floor
'Cause you need it so bad
Taking what I choose
Never going to lose
I love to drive the young girls wild

Going to drive my love inside you
Going to nail your arse to the floor to the floor

Down on your knees, down on your knees, down on your knees
Down on your knees, down on your knees, down on your knees

Down on your knees, down on your knees, down on your knees
Down on your knees, down on your knees, down on your knees


I get up in the morning
Just to work all day
I never had no vacation
And what's a holiday?

I'm tired of working nine to five
Somebody give me a break
Caught up in this rat race
I've got no time to waste

I want out, you can't make it
I want out, no way
I want out, so don't mistake it
It's all that you've got and you're not going to leave it, no way
There's no way

Maybe I'll buy me a new car
Maybe I'll hop on a plane
Get off in some foreign station
Somewhere that don't look the same

I'm tired of working nine to five
Somebody give me a break
Caught up in this rat race
I've got no time to waste

I want out, you can't make it
I want out, no way
I want out, so don't mistake it
It's all that you've got and you're not going to leave it, no way
There's no way

You're stuck in a rut
No, no, you can't give it up
There's no way


Desperate and a loser
A failure at his trade
Nothing more to live for
A decision that he made

He said that he's sorry
But that won't work this time

End of the line, end of the line

Bargained for his freedom
His last chance to run
Forced into a corner
And killed by his own gun

He said that he's sorry
But that won't work this time

End of the line, end of the line
End of the line, end of the line

Can't take it, can't take it, can't take it no more
Can't take it, can't take it, can't take it no more

He said that he's sorry
But that won't work this time

End of the line, end of the line, end of the line
End of the line, end of the line, end of the line

Of the night


The old man told me, hey, you make a choice
You can make the music and stop all your noise
Or you can get out and find your own way
I told him stick it, my rock's here to stay

No, no, I can't live without it
No, no, it just ain't the same
No, no, ain't no doubt about it
No, no, oh so rock me again

I want to roll it and burn it all night
Me and my chevy don't stop for no lights
Cranking the metal, blasting the plant
They want to catch me, bet you they can't

I'm out on the road, and I'm rocking, stick it, stick it
I'm out on the road, there's no stopping, stick it, stick it
I'm out on the road, and I'm rocking, stick it, stick it
I'm out on the road, and I'm gone

I'm out on the road, and I'm rocking, stick it, stick it
I'm out on the road, there's no stopping, stick it, stick it
I'm out on the road, and I'm rocking, stick it, stick it
I'm out on the road, and I'm gone, I'm gone

Stick it, stick it
Stick it, stick it
Stick it, stick it
Stick it, stick it
Stick it, stick it
Stick it, stick it
Stick it, stick it
Stick it, stick it
Stick it, stick it
In your heart


You think we look pretty good together?
You think my jeans are made of leather?

But I'm a substitute for another guy
I look pretty tall but my heels are high
The simple things you see are all complicated
I look pretty young but I'm just backdated

Substitute, your lies for fact
Substitute, I see right through that Satan crap
Substitute, I look all white but my dad was black
Substitute, my fine looking suit's really made out of sack

I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east and east was facing south
But now you dare to look me in the eye
Those are crocodile tears that you cry
A genuine problem you won't try
To work it out at all, just pass it by, pass it by

Substitute, me for him
Substitute, my coke for gin
Substitute, you for my mom
Substitute, at least I'll get my washing done

Young boy, a hard gin ride
On the loose again
Live fast to play both sides
I'm out to win

I'm no loser
I got nothing to lose
My life ain't easy
But it's mine to use

Raised on the streets I know
To get what you want you got to take control

I'm on the run, bad boys
I'm on the loose, bad boys
I'm on my way, bad boys
I've paid my dues

Pull of the trigger
Time starts to crawl
Two lives are ended
When the hammer falls

Raised on the streets I know
To get what you want you got to take control

I'm on the run, bad boys
I'm on the loose, bad boys
I'm on my way, bad boys
I've paid my dues

I'm on the run, bad boys
I'm on the loose, bad boys
I'm on my way, bad boys
I've paid my dues

The lost years were long, each night was cold
The way I felt? Feel the snow
But I did my time, paid what i owed
Don't want those walls of steel and stone

I'm on the run, bad boys
I'm on the loose, bad boys
I'm on my way, bad boys
I've paid my dues

I'm on the run, bad boys
I'm on the loose, bad boys
I'm on my way, bad boys
I've paid my dues

I put myself, bad boys
Behind the walls, bad boys
Now that I'm back, bad boys
Ain't going to fall, bad boys

Beat it boy I found another 

He knows me just like my mother

My tempremental sides

The reasons I dispised

Loving you



So hows it feel to be hung out there

To be the one who doesnt know where

everything went wrong

And why I wrote this song

Just for you



You used to be my happy ever after

but now I know that nothing is forever

You and me

Was misery

I pushed reset

We disconnected



I used to think you were everything

I would need

But now I know you're the crush

That coulda Killed me

Save your breath

'Cause I'm not upset

I'm just over it

And we disconnected



Don't look at me like you're confused

And you can't believe I left you

Like you're some amazing prize

That depends whos eyes you're seeing through



'Cos when I see you I'm reminded

Of all the wrongs you never righted

Underneath your cool

Hope you're drowning in a pool

You've fallen in

'Cos you can't swim



You used to be my happy ever after

but now I know that nothing is forever

You and me

Was misery

I pushed reset

We disconnected



I used to think you were everything

I would need

But now I know you're the crush

That coulda Killed me

Save your breath

'Cause I'm not upset

I'm just over it

And we disconnected



Take back your rollercoaster of a life

I found a better way to waste my time



You used to be my happy ever after

but now I know that nothing is forever

You and me

Was misery

I pushed reset

We disconnected



I used to think you were everything

I would need

But now I know you're the crush



That coulda Killed me

Save your breath

'Cause I'm not upset

I'm just over it

And we disconnected


They wanted me 

To be the dream

But my mood went south

And I'm stuck on the couch with bad jeans

And the couch sucks me down to the floor

And the floor sucks me down to the earth

And I'm covered and buried before

My heart had a chance to start working



Hey, it's heavy underground

I'm screaming for attention

So come dig me out



Hey somebody can you hear me now

'Cause my world is caving in

so come dig me out

It's raining again

And who've guessed

No one's come along to tell me I'm a mess

And the bed sucks me down to the floor

And the floor sucks me down through the earth

And I'm covered and buried before

My head had a chance to stop hurting



Hey, it's heavy underground

I'm screaming for attention

So come dig me out



Hey somebody can you hear me now

'Cause my world is caving in

so come dig me out



I never thought I could fall ten feet under

I always thought someone would remember

To look for me

Before I reach the end



Hey somebody can you hear me now

'Cause my world is caving in

so come dig me out


When I see you 

I forget all that I saw

I don't feel you anymore



Oh I need you

But I don't need nothing at all



But you kiss

That I don't miss

And you smile

That I defile

And oh your touch

It ticks me off and

Oh your way

It makes me crazy

I don't want you

Do you want me

It's an addiction

The friction

Of contradiction



I love you I love you I love you

And when you go



I love you I love you I love you

So tell me no



I love you I love you I love you

Leave me alone



I hate you I hate you I hate you

I need you so



Tell me more now

But don't let me know too much

The knowledge screws me up



I may want you

But I don't want nothing at all

But your time

When I'm busy

And your mind

To make me dizzy

I'll be fine

When you don't miss me

You'll be mine

When you don't piss me off



Why can't you see right through me

And my addiction for friction and contradiction



I love you I love you I love you

Get out of here



I love you I love you I love you

When you're not near



I love you I love you I love you

You're killing me



I hate you I hate you I hate you

What's wrong with me


I'll keep a cool head

'Bout all the things that you said

I've lost my innocence

I'll keep a cool head



I'm not here for you amusement

But I think one thing is clear

I see you with that bitch

When you know you should'a been here with me



I'll keep a cool head

'Bout all the things that you said

I've lost my innocence

I'll keep a cool head



You've got a reputation

For being a ladies man

I've got determination

For thoroughly kicking your ass my friend



It's not cool

'Cause I hate all the things that you do



I'll keep a cool head

'Bout all the things that you said

I've lost my innocence

I'll keep a cool head



No matter what you say to make me stay

I will make you pay

No matter what my gut tells me to say

I'm playing the game

I'm gonna pop

No matter what you say to make me stay

You're gonna pay



I'll keep a cool head

'Bout all the things that you said

I've lost my innocence

I'll keep a cool head



I'll keep a cool head

I'm gonna make you beg

And all the promises

I'll keep a cool head

Yah yah I'll keep a cool head


You don't ever wanna see my face again

But inside you know that it's never gonna end



Bitter memories tell me

You can't help yourself

For hurting me again

But I can rationalize

You're different

'Cos you've changed

You know what you have now

But how can I tell



I break down but I have never seen your tears

I talk straight but your words are never clear

If what you're looking for

Is someone you can hide from

I'm right here



No matter what you said I don't listen to a word

I know you by now and hwo you love me

sometimes hurts



I can take the pain

As long as there's someone

Waiting at the end

I believe you're running

From something you can't see

And I know it's not me

But how how, how can I tell........



I break down but I have never seen your tears

I talk straight but you words are never clear

If what you're looking for

Is someone you can hide from

I'm right here



Bitter memories tell me

You can't help yourself

From hurting me again

But I can rationalize

You're different

'Cos you've changed

You know what you have now

But how can I tell



I break down but I have never seen your tears

I talk straight but your words are never clear

If what you're looking for

Is someone to hide from

I'm right here


You say,

I should do it differently.

I don't,

Necessarily agree. 

Stand up!

Sit down! 

Be nice!

Did ya hear me ask for your advice?



Don't bother,

Trying to tell me your beliefs.

Your point of view is pretty screwed to me.

Do this! 

Do that!

On track!

Do me a favor and don't talk back!



Round and round,

But the conversation always ends where it began.

Round and round, 

And I need a vacation.

I got a headache from you



Shut up! 

Don't want to hear your voice.

Shut up! 

I'm sick of all the noise.

There's nothing you can say

That means a damn thing to me.

Shut up!



Blah Blah, Blah Blah, Blah Blah, Blah Blah. 



That's what,

It sounds like you said to me.

You nag and you brag and I gag,

There's so much beauty in what we have.



You must,

Have better things that you can do.

Or does 

Your life revolve around me too?

What you want, 

What I need. 

Oh please!

I think you get off,

On hearing yourself speak.



Round and round, 

But the conversation always ends where it began.

Round and round, 

And I need a vacation.

I got a headache from you



Shut up! 

Don't want to hear your voice.

Shut up! 

I'm sick of all the noise.

There's nothing you can say

That means a damn thing to me.

Shut up!



Don't want to be polite.

It's messed up, 

How you always think you're right.

There's nothing you can say,

That's gonna change the way I am.

Shut up!

Shut up!




Rude in a moment there 





All my pain, all my lovin, all my sacrifice going into this track.





Shut the fuck up.



Don't look for me. 

'Cos I won't be found

Don't blame yourself

When I turn you down

Whatever you do

Don't believe

That it's about you



My head's on the run

And it's running for us

I've only begun

and I'll never be done

On my own's where I know

And nobody can hold

Me down when I come

'Cos my head's on the run



And what you think

Doesn't matter much

I do my thing

and you're not that tough

Whatever you do

Don't believe I'm changing for you



My head's on the run

And it's running for us

I've only begun

and I'll never be done

On my own's where I know

And nobody can hold

Me down when I come

'Cos my head's on the run



Head's on the run 



My head's on the run

And it's running for us

I've only begun

and I'll never be done

On my own's where I know

And nobody can hold

Me down when I come

'Cos my head's on the run



Head's on the run 


Some people

Think they know what I should do

Well they don't really know

What I've been through



And I don't care

Don't care what you have to say

'Cause it's my life

And I'll do as I may



When I find you

I better find you alone

When I call you

You better pick up the phone

When I dump you

You're gonna be on your own

On your own



Remember

When you gave that number to her

Well she don't really know

Where I have been

And I don't care

Don't care what you think of me

It's my life

And I'll do as I please



When I find you

I better find you alone

When I call you

You better pick up the phone

When I dump you

you're gonna be on your own

On your own



Picking up the trash can

Playing your life hard

Dealing me a shit hand

Playing with the wrong card

Bringing on the new days

Leaving back the old ways

It don't matter what you have to say

Walk on boy



When I find you

I better find you alone

When I call you

You better pick up the phone

When I dump you

You're gonna be on your own

On your own


What Can I say

You got me good

Swallow me up,

Spit me out

Got me hooked

What can I do,

But play the fool

And wait around

for you to come,

you never do.

So I sit for days

Imagining a different way.





Coz, I love it in the mornin

Its like a new day comin

Every time baby,

Too Much of you

is not enough

I want it in the evening

You give it all new meaning

And I cant lie (baby)

Too Much of you is not enough

Too Much of you is not enough.

I catch my breath

At it again

You swirl around,

In my head

I never win.

Your everything

I didn't need

The doctor says

All these wasted days

Cant keep myself away

from me







na na na na, na na na na na na

Hey

na na na na, na na na na na na





Too Much of you is not enough

Too Much of you is not enough.


10,000 hours to go before we're kicking it

all night

feels like my mind will explode

If we don't bust it out tonight



Fuck that bullshit

Need to relax

Get my head straight

Put my face on

Shove my hair up

My ass is in gear and now

Everything's alright



Grab all my shit and just go

Got no worries feeling fine

Pull up to this spot that I know

and now I finally feel alive

Well the daytime's gone now



Well the room's all full now

People crushing

Noise is hurting

ears are humming

My back's sweating

I'm losing my mind

I'm losing my mind hard

Everything's alright



Now lights are swimming

Stomach's heaving

Bed is spinning

Crotch is itching

Hands are feeling

Legs are kicking

And now, now, now

Everything's alright

Waiting for a street fight
Clock strikes midnight
I got a bad reputation
So what the hell
'Cause we ain't doin' nothing
I ain't never done before
So give me all you got, babe
I could use a little more
You try bringing me up
But you're dragging me down
What you got, I ain't looking for
I'm out for blood
I'm out for blood
Carried a switch blade
Since you were thirteen
You never won a battle
So don't fight with me
'Cause you ain't really nothing
Tried to tell you that before
So get your ammunition
'Cause I'm ready for war
Wasting my time
Frying my mind
And I am not
So, what you take me for?
I'm out for blood
I'm out for blood
I'm out for blood
I'm out for blood
I'm out for blood


I find you alone at night
I don't know what you're thinking
Don't know what you're dreaming of
But it ain't me, now is it?
But I gotta know
I can't let my feelings show
'Cause I've always wanted you to give me a chance
Now that I've got you here
You know what you gotta do
Stay with me, baby
I don't wanna make love to nobody else
Stay with me, baby
I'm so tired of waiting, come down off yourself
Stay, baby
To feel you alone like this
I would throw all my kisses
And throw all my love away
But that ain't right, now, is it?
Well someday you'll realize
I was not blind
If I could come along with someone like you?
To save my broken heart
Here's what you gotta do
Stay with me, baby
I don't wanna make love to nobody else
Stay with me, baby
I'm so tired of waiting, come down off yourself
Stay, baby
Oh, yeah
I want you to stay
I find you alone at night
I don't know what you're thinking
Don't know what you're dreaming of
But that ain't right, now is it?
Someday you'll realize
I was not blind
If I could come along with someone like you?
To save my broken heart
You know what you gotta do
Stay with me, baby
I don't wanna make love to nobody else
Stay with me, baby
I'm so tired of waiting, come down off yourself
And stay, baby
With me, with me, with me
Won't you stay with me
Stay with me
With me, with me, with me
Won't you stay with me
With me, with me, with me
Won't you stay with me
With me, with me, with me
Won't you stay with me
With me, with me, with me
Won't you stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Won't you stay with me?


It's been five days, my mind's in a haze
I don't know if I'm comin' or goin'
I'm so confused, that you're the one I choose
So rock with me, babe, let's get it rollin'
It's just a feeling that I get
From the first time I ever met you, babe
It's just a feeling I can't forget
So don't kiss me goodbye, just give one more try at your love
The days go fast, you're stuck in my head
I'm so alone, I wish you'd tuck me in bed

Yeah, right from the start
'Cause it's just a feeling
Feeling
That I get
From the first time I ever met you, babe
It's just a feeling
Feeling
It makes me wet
So don't kiss me goodbye, just give one more try
At your love
Yeah
Oh, when you told me that you don't want me no more
I said, "I love you," ah, but you wanted more
Oh, baby, baby, baby, well I knew it from the start
Yeah, right from the start
'Cause it's just a feeling
Feeling
That I get
From the first time I ever met you, babe
It's just a feeling
Feeling
I can't forget
So don't kiss me goodbye, just give one more try at your love
Won't you give me one more try?


I'm no angel
I'm far from it
Yeah, when push comes to shove
I can rise above it
I get down
But I ain't easy
I spoil myself
So it's so hard to please me
Baby, I'm ready, willing and able
And if you feel like a man, lay your cards on the table
I don't gamble
But I take chances
And if love is a game
That a fool romances
Then I'm a fool
One more time
So start makin' your move
Before I change my mind
Baby, I'm ready, willing and able
And if you feel like a man, lay your cards on the table
So get your ass in gear and do it for me babe
Uh, get down
Well, you're different
To say the least
Yeah, you've got the power
To change the nature of the beast
Well, only time
Will really tell
But, on down the line
I know I'm still alive and well
Baby, I'm ready, willing and able
So get your ass in gear and do it for me babe
Get down


Plays with a vengeance
Controls our very soul
To weave you in my web of love
And never let you go
Time to face your destiny
You've lived come and go
To die for me only
I live just for you
Die for me only
I live only for you
Passion fed by fire, it's far beyond control
Holds us in a sacred flame
And never lets us go
It's meant to be
It's your destiny
To die for me only
I live just for you
Die for me only
I live only for you
Black Widow
Black Widow
Your loving is a death wish
It makes it all come true
I'll love you to death, babe
And suck your life from you
It's meant to be
It's your destiny
Die for me only
I live just for you
Die for me only
I live only for you
Black Widow


I used to listen to the radio
Playin' songs I wanted to hear
Up in my room and played it loud
'Til the music hurt my ear
My parents said to turn it down
But this is what I'd say
Rock & Roll made me what I am today
Rock & Roll made me what I am today
I had a dream that I was sweet 16
And could play in a rock & roll band
I saw some guys that played guitar
They said, "Come on if you think you can."
And the next thing that I know
I find myself right here on the stage
Rock & Roll made me what I am today
Rock & Roll made me what I am today
Rock & Roll made me what I am...
You know people are always tellin' me
To get out before its too late
Say, "It's a passing fad."
And that the money's bad
I'm gonna wind up in a grave
But if I could do it all again, you know I would not change a thing
Rock & Roll made me what I am today
Rock & Roll made me what I am today
Rock & Roll made me what I am today
Rock & Roll made me what I am today
Rock & Roll made me what I am today
Rock & Roll made me what I am today
Rock & Roll made me what I am today
Rock & Roll made me what I am today
Rock & Roll made me what I am today
Rock & Roll made me what I am today
Rock & Roll made me what I am today


I know life gets rough
Oh, sometimes I cry
But you gotta try a little harder
When you're wrong!
Sometimes I got no friends
Well, that just kinda makes my heart a mess
So I just slap myself in the face and say
It's alright, I still got my guitar
Everyone knows love's a game
Playin' to win but it won't turn out that way
So I just stay at home and have another beer
But shit, you can't live with it
Then try and live without it
If you can't live with it
Then try and live without it
Don't you think people are strange?
They never do what they say, no
Hanging you up and making life tough
Don't need to be that way
Don't give me your sympathy
It's for the devil, baby, not me
And don't tell me that I'm wrong
See everyone knows love's a game
Playin' to win but it don't turn out that way
So I just stay at home and have another beer
'Cause if you can't live with it
Then try and live without it
If you can't live with it
Then try and live without it
Yeah
See everyone knows love's a game
Playin' to win but it don't turn out that way
So I just stay at home and have another beer
'Cause if you can't live with it
Then try and live without it
If you can't live with it
Then try and live without it
If you can't live with it
Then try and live without it... yeah


Going to town, I'm gonna tear it down
I'm looking for some action
To get a piece of your heart
I lose a piece of my head
It's like a chain reaction
Your love has got me hypnotized
You don't wanna see
My love for you, it's over now
It's time for me to leave
I'm on the run, yeah
On the run, yeah
Oh, let me outta here, I don't wanna hear
Your bullshit confession
Just a smack in the head
You moan in pain in your bed
Staring at no reflection
My mind is racing with the flood
The time is moving fast
My love for you is over now
This love could never last
I'm on the run, yeah
On the run, yeah
What we used to call love, is now one step above
Mental masturbation
Now, I'm bustin' out of this livin' hell
Like a bullet from a shotgun
The road has got me hypnotized
And you don't want to see
That my love for you is dead, is torn
Now I'm on the run


If it's love that you want, then, baby, you've got it
From the depths of my soul, yeah, uw baby, you've got it
'Cause I've been watching you, and I don't think that you'll gain
And there's no need to explain
Any way that you want me, any way that you'll take me
Any way that you'll make me be a part of you, any way at all
If there's dreams in your heart, the love lasts forever
From the depths of my soul, I'm making love control, for me and you
'Cause I've been watching you, and I don't think that you'll gain
And there's no need to explain
Any way that you want me, any way that you'll take me
Any way that you'll make me be a part of you, any way at all
Nothing you can say or do
Can turn my heart away
But my love for you keeps growing stronger
Each and every day
You know you can have it any way you want it
I'll give you all I've got to give
You can take it, any way
Any way, any way
Any way, any way
Any way, any way
Any way
Any way that you want me, any way that you'll take me
Any way that you'll make me be a part of you
Any way that you want me
Any way that you want me
Any way that you'll take me


I still remember everything you said
I'll love ya tonight but don't get uptight, no
Then I knew I'd never see you again
I want to make up with you but what can I do?
I can't stand it
Tonight you're here but tomorrow you're gone, oh, no
I can't stand it
The love that was real, got wasted away, oh, it's gone
I still remember the look in your eyes
Well, I wish I could fly, you make me cry
'Cause you were somethin' that I never had
And I never will but still I keep dreamin' of...
I can't stand it
Tonight you're here but tomorrow you're gone, oh, no
I can't stand it
The love that was real, got wasted away, oh, it's gone
I will wait forever, just to have you one more time
'Cause it's the only way, I can't ever keep you out of my mind
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
You know there's no other way
I can't stand it
You know I can't take it no more...


>> tesla

You had it right in the palm of your hand, right before your eyes
Now it's gone and you don't understand, you've got to realize

There comes a time when you've got to let things go as fast as they come
Wait and see what tomorrow may bring you, get it all while you can

Sometimes it just feels so right, and other times so wrong
Every new day it brings on the night, the change goes on and on and on and on

It never stops, no it keeps on rollin', wiped away like an (arch of) sand
Here it comes, there it goes, always changin' ends

Ez come ez go, ez come ez go, that's what they call it
Ez come ez go, ez come ez go, oh no!



Ez come ez go, ez come ez go, oh, you know that's what they call it
Ez come ez go, ez come ez go, oh whoa!

Talk of let go when it took so long to get, it's (how the lovin' goes)


I'm a mean machine, I'm the kind you don't wanna meet
My middle name is trouble, I'm a danger in the street
My motor's in overdrive, I got my pedal to the floor
Never get enough, always comin' back for more - yeah yeah

Here I come, better step aside
Here I come, I'm comin' atcha live, comin' atcha live

I'm the one you want, I never give a warning twice
Anything could happen like the rollin' of the dice - now!

Here I come, you better step aside
Here I come, comin' atcha live

Comin' at you live - comin' atcha live
Comin' at you live - comin' atcha live
Comin' at you live - oh here I come

Come on!



Comin' at you live - I'm comin' atcha live
Comin' at you live - comin' atcha live
Comin' at you live - oh here I come
Comin' at you live - step aside, oh step aside

Ow! Ow! Oh yeah, here I come - here I come!


All that rain outside my window, it goes on and on, I know
It's gettin' better every day
Soon the sun will shine outside my window, when it's gonna come
No I really, I couldn't say
No no no no no no, it's gettin' better every day - thank you

Can you hear it? Oh, it's gettin' better now, every day, yeah yeah yeah yeah

I'm a hard workin' man, doin' all that I can, tryin' to make ends meet
Just a-makin' my way through the jungle today, it's gettin' the best of me

But it's only gettin' better, and a change is gonna come my way
Yes it's only gettin' better, better every day, aha yeah

I've been changin' the scene, if you know what I mean
Good things are comin' my way
And now I'm livin' my life, and I try doin' it right
Sun shinin' every day

Well it's only gettin' better, and a change is gonna come my way
Yes it's only gettin' better, better every day



Now it's only gettin' better, and a change is gonna come my way
Yes it's only so much better, oh, gettin' better every day, yeah
I can feel it, feel it gettin' better, whoa, day and night
I feel it, feel it gettin' better every day
Gettin' better, it's gettin' better, it's gettin' better


One two three four!

I can't believe this fucked up world in which we're livin' in
Still I do the best that I can
Always got me on the lookout for a getaway
Runnin' hard, I'm a rock 'n' roll man

I know we can make it (and go, said that) all you gotta do is sign
Tellin' you all I wanna do is rock 'n' roll


Too late for love - baby it's too late
Too late for love - girl I gotta say
That it's you, I know, that makes me feel this way
Don't you know that it's too late for love

Foolish hearts gettin' caught up in a lover's game
That's the way some want it to be
Now all I need is someone, just to get me through the night
Any more is too much for me

I know we can make it (and go, said that) all you gotta do is sign
Tellin' you all I wanna do is rock 'n' roll



Oh baby it's too late, too late for love, too late, oh yeah



Too late for love, oh baby baby, it's too late for love
Too late for love, oh, I tell ya, it's too late for love

'Cos all I need is someone standin' by my side
I don't care if I have to see you cry
You oughta know my name, yes, it's too late for love


You gotta see him, are you ready, to take me in and rock me steady
Feel the power, feel the heat, put yourself in the driver's seat

You're in the air, I feel you surround me
I'll do anything that you wanna do - come on!


Rock me, rock me (rock), rock me to the top, to the top, baby
Rock me, rock me (rock), don't ever stop, no

I'll take command, take control, now I see you comin' back for more
I see you like it, but you don't need it, oooh, you wanna feel it

I'm in the air, feel me surround me

Rock me, rock me (rock), rock me to the top, (says you looked hot) to the top
Rock me, rock me (rock), ohh baby don't you stop
(Rock) I wanna feel the air, the air, wanna feel the air (rock)
I wanna feel the air tonight, can you feel the air, ow!


Every day, yeah yeah, I wait till the morning light
Ooh with a feeling, yeah yeah, something here ain't right
When I think about it now, oh baby, ooh
When I think about all the good times we had
I knew there was something wrong, there was no chance for me and you

Oh now, now I try to tell you baby, there ain't nothing we can do
'Cos I'm no good for you, oh no baby, you're no good for me

Now it's been so long, so long, since the last time I've seen your face
I tell ya, there ain't nobody baby, in this whole wide world
Who could ever take your place, no way, oh no

Now I try to tell you baby, there ain't nothing we can do
'Cos I'm no good for you, no baby, you're no good for me
Oh, what I'm tryin' to say is, we're no good together

You know we can't go on, we can't go on together, no, oh baby
Honey we can't go on, we can't go on this way, baby, oh yeah
Listen to me, oh listen to me, I got something to say, I got something to say
I say that we're no good together, we're no good together
Now what's going round, you're all over town, and you're bringin' me down



Oh baby, we're no good together, we're no good together
We're no good together

Oh baby baby baby babe you know it's just no good
Oh it's no good together, oh oh, no good together



Stormy night under jet black skies, billy pulls into town
Thunder rolled and the lightning bolts come crashin' to the ground
Cold as ice, hard as stone, as he walks into the room
With another man who was feeling the same way, all hell's breakin' loose


Bang bang, shoot 'em up, bang bang, blow you away
It's a showdown in the no man's land, for the cowboy of the modern day
Come sundown, don't be hangin' round, 'cause the cowboy'll blow you away


Al Capone and the Bad Boy Jones, on the wrong side of the law
Johnny D and his company, always first to the draw,
Gangster lean, feelin' so mean, I try to take more than their share
'Cause all they saw was ruling it all, the scent of blood was in the air






So here we are and we've come this far, but it's only getting worse
Foreign lands with their terrorist demands, only cause the good to hurt
The U.S.A., the U.S.S.R., with their six-guns to the side
I see the message written on the wall, too much anger deep inside



It's a showdown!


Changes, time's makin' changes in my life
Rearrangin', can't seem to stop the hands of time
I remember, I was so young, I was much too young to see
Now I'm older, growing older, and I see things differently
Oh can't you see, it's changin' you and me


Time's makin' changes, time's makin' changes in my life
Time's rearrangin', changin' you and me

Faces, strange faces cloud my mind
Empty traces, make it hard for me to find
Somewhere in the distance, is there someone who awaits
For that moment I am taken over by the hands of fate
Can't you see, the world is changin' me

 - yeah yeah

Nothin' ever stays the same, it's always gonna change
I'm on my way, yeah yeah



Changes, time's makin' changes in my life
Rearrangin', always changin', can't seem to stop the hands of time
Can't you see, it's changin' everything

 - yeah yeah

Oh all these changes


Little Suzi's on the up, looking for a get-away

Certain things ya do really make me mad I must confess
The way the street light sihlouettes your thighs inside your dress
Wild child in the streets I think I've seen you but I really don't know
One million miles an hour headed out to where the down boys go

Whoa, can we rewind to where we've been

Street fighting is looking for trouble
If you open your mouth
You're bound to rumble
Johnny looks tough
He's froze in the eyes
He keeps his mouth shut
He don't tell no lies

Johnny went out last night
Got in a bar room fight
Embarrassed a jealous man
In front if his cheating wife
The man said "Tonight you won
But I'll tell you son,
This one's far from over"
Johnny said

Big talk is just talk
Unless, unless you're backing it up
Big talk is cheap talk is
Only words unless you're backing it up
(We're backin' it up)

Now I don't know why
Some men lay down and die
Don't they believe in what they're saying
You should get on your feet
Believe you can't be beat
Remember talk is only playing

Big talk is just talk
Unless, unless you're backing it up
Big talk is cheap talk is
Only words unless you're backing it up
(We're backin' it up)

I remember what my old man used to say
(We're backin' it up)
Never give up and run
(We're backin' it up)
Don't let the talkin' breeze blow you away
Always remember, stick to your guns

Big talk is looking for trouble
If you open your mouth
You better be ready to rumble

Big talk is just talk
Unless, unless you're backing it up
Big talk is cheap talk is
Only words unless you're backing it up, I say

Big talk is just talk
Unless, unless you're backing it up
Big talk is cheap talk is
Only words unless you're backing it up
(We're backin' it up)

We all say
Big talk is just talk
Unless, unless you're backing it up
Oh we're backin' it up
We're backing it up, yeah


Mercy don't think she's pretty no more,
Starin' at the stars through her back screen door,
She tries and tries to make it all work out,
No matter what she does,
She's left standin' in the middle of doubt,
In a lonely night,
And in the pourin' rain,
You can count on me,

Sometimes she cries,
When she's alone at night,
Sometimes she weeps,
When she's feelin' cold and weak,
Sometimes the pain,
It just tears her up inside,
Sometimes she cries,
Ooh, I wonder why,

Mercy don't have a lover no more,
She plays with her pillow,
Stares at the bedroom floor,
Used to have a million,
They've come and gone,
No matter what she does,
She can't figure out what she's doin' wrong,
In a lonely night,
And in the pourin' rain,
You can count on me,

Sometimes she cries,
When she's alone at night,
Sometimes she weeps,
When she's feelin' cold and weak,
Sometimes the pain,
Oh, it tears her up inside,
Sometimes she cries,
Ooh, yeah

Livin', lovin', give it everything you've got,
After all the heartache,
Maybe give love just one more shot yeah,

In a lonely night,
And in the pourin' rain,
The only thing I really wanna know is why,

Sometimes she cries,
When she's alone at night,
Sometimes she weeps,
When she's feelin cold and weak,
Sometimes the pain,
Oh, it tears her up inside,
Sometimes she cries
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Maybe even hold your hand, yeah

Something about you sweetheart

But me and the city, we just don't mix

Dancin' on a moonbeam
When I finally caught your name
Said, "You had to be goin' soon"
And I said that, "That's a shame"
Took you down to the willow pond
Where the cat tails grow real high
And in a few brief moments
We waved our childhood goodbye

Hey girl, I got love
Love enough for you, ohh
In the sticks, its you and me baby
You know ain't no country hick
Me and the city, we just don't mix
We just don't mix
Lets go

In the sticks
Ooh, well it's you and me baby
And I ain't no country hick
Me and the city, we just don't mix

Oh yeah
In the sticks
With just you and me baby
Yaa I ain't no country hick
But me and the city, we just don't mix
We just don't mix
We just don't mix

Oh oh oh


I've got a picture of your house
And you're standing by the door.
It's black and white and faded,
And it's looking pretty worn.
See the factory that I worked
Silhouetted in the back.
The memories are gray but man they're really coming back.

I don't need to be the king of the world
As long as i'm the hero of this little girl

Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it everyday 
No matter what your friends might say

How I love the way you move
And the sparkle in your eyes
There's a color deep inside them
Like blue suburban skys
When i come home late at night
And you're in bed asleep
I wrap my arms around you
So I can feel you breathe

I dont need to be a superman
As long as you will always be my biggest fan

Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it everyday (Ah, ah)
No matter what your friends might say
We'll find our way, yeah

Now the lights are going out,
Along the boulevard
Memories come rushing back and makes it pretty hard
I've got nowhere left to go
And no one really cares
I don't know what to do
But I'm never giving up on you.

Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
ohhhh ohhh
No matter what your friends say
I know we're gonna find a way

(Heaven)

Whoah, oohh, ohhh
Whoah, oohh, ohhh

(Heaven)

It's not too far away

Whoah, oohh, ohhh

Yeah yeah yeah


I'm living just to live it up, whoa yeah

Since the day that I was born, I've been rockin' round my block
Just a leather coated lover with a tattoo on my heart, yeah

Now I'm going downtown feel I should strut my stuff, babe
Workin' on one track mind and baby that's not all
Now keep the motor running 'cuz I ain't got time to waste
I'm dressing for success, I guess I'm blessed with good taste

Ain't no dream you're seeing things you've never seen before, oh yeah
Well I'm breathing down your neck, knocking down your door, yeah

Living just to live it up, ridin' high, ridin' free
Gonna live it up before they bury me, grade yourselves 103
Gonna live it up, before they bury me, hope the bury me, yeah

Living just to live it up, ridin' high, ridin' free
Gonna live it up before they bury me, grade yourselves 103
Gonna live it up, before they bury me, yeah
Oh yeah

Gonna live up, gonna live it up
Gonna live up, living just to live it up


I've got alligator shoes
And I've beeb makin' news
I've got plenty of women
I've got plenty of booze
(Give me a shot)

Walked into the spot light
At the local bar and grill
Find a down and dirty woman
Well I'm gonna take my fill
Look right into her bloodshot eyes and
Scream my honey, I'm gonna make you mine

I paid the tab
I called a cab
Went back to my place
Had a hell of a time

I get excited
I feel loose
I move to quick and I get
Caught in your noose

(And I sweat)
Every time that we touch
(And I sweat)
I get the chills up and down my spine
(Cold sweat)
You bet, you bet
Its a midnight stage freight
Ice cold sweat

Ooh we went home
All alone
Then we turned down the lights
And unplugged the phone
Well I'm a snake
But I'm no liar
Makin' love to me is like
Pouring gasoline on a fire
I feel loose
I move to quick and I get caught in your noose

(And I sweat)
Every time that we touch
(And I sweat)
I get the chills up and down my spine
(Cold sweat)
You bet, you bet
Its a midnight stage freight
Ice cold

All I want is a little action
Ooh a little bit of satisfaction
You beat me down
Then kick me out
So scream and shout
And shout shout
Oh yeah

Then I sweat
(Sweat)
Then I sweat
(Sweat)
Then I sweat
(Sweat)
Then I sweat
Sweat
(Cold sweat)
(Cold sweat)
I get the feeling every time
We fu fu fu fu fu
(Cold sweat)
You bet you bet
(Cold sweat)

Ice cold

Think you could probably do somethin for the kids for graduation to sing?






And all my people thats drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high

Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say





If this is your first time hearing this 

You are about to experience something cold man

We never had nothing handed took nothing for granted

Took nothing from no man, man i'm my own man

But as a shorty i looked up to the dopeman

Only adult man i knew that wasnt a broke man

Flickin starter coats man, Man you ount no man

We don't care what people say

This is for my niggas outside all winter

Cuz this summer they aint finna to say next summer im finna

Sittin in the hood like community colleges

This dope money here is Lil Treys scholarship

Cause aint no to tuition for havin no ambition

And aint no loans for sittin your ass at home

So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job

You gotta do something man your ass is grown







Drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high



Kids Sing Kids Sing





We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive

Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say





The second verse is for my dogs working 9 to 5

That still hustle cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55

And everybody selling make-up, Jacobs

And bootleg tapes just to get they cake up

We put shit on layaway then come back

We claim other people kids on our income tax

We take that money cop work than push packs to get paid

And we don't care what people say

Momma say she wanna move south 

Scratchin lottery tickets Eyes on a new house

Around the same time Doe ran up in dudes house 

Couldnt get a job

So since he couldnt get work he figured hed take work

The drug game bolemic its hard to get weight

So niggas money is homo its hard to get straight

So we gon keep baking to the day we get cake.

And we dont care what people say 

My Niggas 







Drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high



Kids Sing Kids Sing



We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive

Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say





You know the kids gonna act a fool

When you stop the programs for after school

And they DCFS them some of them dislecsic

They favorite 50 Cent song's 12 Questions

We scream, rock, blows, weed park 

so now we smart

We aint retards the way teachers thought

Hold up hold fast we make mo'cash

Now tell my momma i belong in the slow class 

It's bad enough we on welfare

You trying to put me on the school bus with the space for the wheel chair

Im trying to get the car with the chromy wheels here

You tryin to cut our lights like we dont live here

Look at whats handed us our fatheres abandoned us

When we get the hammers gone and call the ambulance

Sometimes i feel no one in this world understands us

But we dont care what people say

My Niggas







drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high



Kids Sing Kids Sing



We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive

Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say


What in the fuck was that Kanye

I told you to do some shit for the kids

You can give me your muthafucking graduation ticket right now

You will not walk across that stage, you won’t slide across that stage

A muthafucka can’t pull you across that stage Kanye

Who told you see, I told you to do something up lifting

I’m trynna get you out here with these white people and this how you gone do me

You know what us a nigga

And I don’t mean that in no nice way

Had little kids sing about the shit, the jokes on you

You throw your mutha hands in the air, and wave good-bye to everybody

Cause you getting the fuck out of this campus

Mutha what you gone do now



I'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody.

I'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody.

I got something better than school but don't tell anybody.

My momma would kill me but don't anybody.

she wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody. 

She ain'twalked in my shoes i'm just not everybody.




Oh when it all, it all falls down

I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down





Man I promise, she's so self conscious

She has no idea what she's doing in college

That major that she majored in don't make no money

But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny

Now, tell me that ain't insecurrre

The concept of school seems so securrre

Sophmore three yearrrs aint picked a careerrr

She like fuck it, I'll just stay down herre and do hair

Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs

Cause her baby daddy don't really care

She's so precious with the peer pressure

Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus (a Lexus)

She had hair so long that it looked like weave

Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve

And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe

Single black female addicted to retail and well









Man I promise, I'm so self conscious

That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches

Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy

I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!

Then I spent 400 bucks on this

Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!

And I can't even go to the grocery store

Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team

It seems we living the american dream

But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem

The prettiest people do the ugliest things

For the road to riches and diamond rings

We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us

We trying to buy back our 40 acres

And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop

Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe









I say fuck the police, thats how I treat em

We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom

We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em

Things we buy to cover up what's inside

Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth

That's why shortys hollering "where the ballas' at?"

Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack

And a white man get paid off of all of that

But I ain't even gon act holier than thou

Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou

Before I had a house and I'd do it again

Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz

I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific

I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific

I got a problem with spending before I get it

We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it






Some glad morning when this life is over,

I'll fly away.

To a home on God's celestial shore,

I'll fly away.



I'll fly away, O Glory,

I'll fly away.

When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye,

I'll fly away.



When the shadows of this life have flown,

I'll fly away.

Like a bird thrown, driven by the storm,

I'll fly away.



I'll fly away, O Glory,

I'll fly away.

When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye,

I'll fly away.



Just a few more weary days and then,

I'll fly away.

To a land where joy shall never end,

I'll fly away.



I'll fly away, O Glory,

I'll fly away.

When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye,

I'll fly away.




I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky





Man, man, man

If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him

After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up

Let's go back, back to the Gap

Look at my check, wasn't no scratch

So if I stole, wasn't my fault

Yeah I stole, never got caught

They take me to the back and pat me

Askin' me about some khakis

But let some black people walk in

I bet they show off their token blackie

Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store

Saw him on break next to the 'No Smoking' sign with a blunt and a Mall'

Takin' my hits, writin' my hits

Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind

This fuckin' job can't help him

So I quit, y'all welcome

Y'all don't know my struggle

Y'all can't match my hustle

You can't catch my hustle

You can't fathom my love dude

Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers

That's a different world like Kree Summers

I deserve to do these numbers

The kid that made that deserves that Maybach

So many records in my basement

I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow





I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky





Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky

Let's go, yeah

And I didn't even try to work a job

Represent the mob

At the same time thirsty on the grind

Chi state of mind

Lost my momma, lost my mind

+My life, my love+ that's not mine

Why you ain't signed?

Wasn't my time

Leave me alone, work for y'all

Half of it's yours, half of it's mine

Only one to ball

Never one to fall

Gotta get mine

Gotta take mine

Got a tech nine

Reach my prime

Gotta make these haters respect mine

In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule said nine

Puttin' them pants on shelves

Waitin' paitently I ask myself

Where I wanna go, where I wanna be

Life is much more than runnin' in the streets

Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat

Put me on my feet

Sound so sweet

Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee

Stayin' low key, nope

Holler at God "Man why'd you had to take my folks?"

Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G

Love my G, Rolly G

Police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's

Got a lot of people countin' on me

And I'm just tryin' to find my peace

Should of finished school like my niece

Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow

Aw man, all this pressure





I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky





I remember havin' to take the dollar cab

Comin' home real late at night

Standin' on my feet all damn day

Tryin' to make this thing right

And havin' one of my co-workers say "Yo you look just like

This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night"

Well easy come, easy go

How that sayin' goes

No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows

I all had that snatched from me

And all the faculties all turn their back on me

And didn't wanna hear a rap from me

So naturally actually had to face things factually

Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin' back at me

Cuz nothing's there, nothing's fair

I don't wanna ever go back there

So I won't be takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off





I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky





I wanna fly, I wanna fly

I said I want my chariot to pick me up

And take me brother for a ride


Yo, We at war
We at war with terrorism, racism, and most of all we at war with ourselves
(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the Devil trying to break me down
(Jesus Walks with me) with me, with me, with me 

You know what the Midwest is?
Young & Restless
Where restless (Niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (Niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless Uhhhh!
Try to catch it Uhhhh! It's kinda hard hard
Getting choked by the detectives yeah yeah now check the method
They be asking us questions, harass and arrest us
Saying "we eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast"
Huh? Yall eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A truck full of crap rental car from Avis
My momma used to say only Jesus can save us
Well momma I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November I got packs to move I Hope


(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the Devil trying to break me down
(Jesus Walks with me)
The only thing that that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus Walks)
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus Walks with me)
I want to talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long

To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers
(Jesus walks with them)
To the victims of Welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah
(Jesus walks with them)
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers are role models we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, video tapes
But if I talk about God my record won't get played Huh?
Well let this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out

(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(Jesus Walks)
The only thing that that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus Walks)
And I don't thing there's nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus walks with me... fades)
I want to talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long




Yeah Grandmama

Told you I won't let you down

Told you I won't let this rap game change me, right?





When it comes to being true, at least true to me

One thing I found,one thing I found

Oh no you'll neva let me down,

Get up I get(down)

Get up I get(down)

Get up I get(down)

Get up I get(down)

Get up I get(down)

Get up I get(down)





Yo, yo first I snatched the street then I snatched the charts,

First had they ear now I hav they're heart,

Rappers came and went,

I've been hear from the start,

Seen them put it together

Watch them take it apart,

See the Rovers roll up wit ribbons

I've seen them re-poed, re-sold and re-driven

So when I reload, he holds #1 position

When u hot I'm hot

And when your feet cold, mines is sizzelin

It's plain to see

Nigga's can't f*** wit me

Cuz ima be that nigga fo life

This is not an image

This is God given

This is hard liven

Mixed wit crystal sipping

It's the most consistent

Hov

Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and

Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggaz visitin

It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordan of rap

I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy









I get down for my grandfather who took my momma

Made her sit that seat where white folks ain't wanna us to eat

At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in

With that in my blood I was born to be different

Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership

But we can make it to Jacob and to the dealership

That's why I hear new music

And I just don't be feeling it

Racism still alive they just be concealing it

But I know they don't want me in the damn club

They even made me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club

I did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed

Swear I've been baptised at least 3 or 4 times

But in the land where nigga's praise

Yukons and getting paid

It gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved

Like it take a lot more than do-rags to get your waves

Noting sadder than that day my girl father past away

So I promised to Mr Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter

And u know I gotta thank u for they way that she was brought up

And I know that u were smiling when u see that car I bought her

And u sent tears from heaven when u seen my car get balled up

But I can't complaint what the accident did to my Left Eye

Cuz look what a accident did to Left Eye

First Aaliyah and now romeo must die

I know a got angels watching me from the other side









We are all here for a reason on a particular path

You don't need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math

Cats think I'm delirious, but I'm so damn serious

That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world

I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls

I'm not just another individual, my spirit is a part of this

That's why I get spiritual, but I get my hymns from Him

So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical

I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument

My rhythmatic regimen navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental

That's why I'm instrumental

Vibrations is what I'm into

Yeah, I need my loot by rent day

But that is not what gives me the heart of Kunte Kinte

I'm tryina give us "us free" like Cinque

I can't stop, that's why I'm hot

Determination, dedication, motivation

I'm talking to you, my many inspirations

When I say I can't, let you or self down

If I were of the highest cliff, on the highest riff

And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life in my grip

I would never, ever let you down

And when these words are found

Let it been known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love

That's why my breath is felt by the deaf

And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind

I, too, dream in color and in rhyme

So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house

Cuz whenever I open my heart, my soul, or my mouth

A touch of God reigns out









Who else you know been hot this long,

(Oh Ya, you know we ain't finished)

Started from nothing but he got this strong,

(The ROC is in the building)

Built the ROC from a pebble, pedalled rock before I met you,

Pedalled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special,

Let you tell that man I'm falling,

Well somebody must've caught him,

Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em,

Number one albums, what I got like four of dem,

More of dem on the way,

The Eight Wonder on the way,

Clear the way, I'm here to stay,

Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that, this and Jay,

Dissin' Jay 'ill get you mased,

When I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious,

Six Hail Maries, please Father forgive us,

Young, the Archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas,

The way y'all all follow Jigga,

Hov's a living legend and I tell you why,

Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov still alive.



I'm trying to catch the beat, uh
I'm trying to catch the beat
I'm trying to catch the beat, uh uh, uh
I'm trying to catch the beat


Now, throw your motherfucking hands
GET 'EM HIGH
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man
GET 'EM HIGH
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
KEEP 'EM HIGH
And if your losing your high then* smoke again
KEEP 'EM HIGH


Now, my flow
Is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
'til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta college
My teacher said I'm a loser, I told her why don't you kill me
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow my heart,
And if you follow the charts, or the plaques or the stacks
You ain't gotta guess who's back,
You see I'm so Chi that you thought it was bashful
But this bastard's flow will bash a skull
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Troy
And I don't usually smoke but pass the 'dro
And I won't give you that money that you asking for
Why you think me and Dame cool? We're assholes!
That's why we hear your music in fast forward
'Cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no more




Now who the hell is this?
E-mailing me at 11:26, telling me that she 36-26, plus double D
You know how girls on black planet be when they get bubbly
At NYU but she hail from Kansas, right now she just lampin, chilling on campus
Sent me a picture with her feeling on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T, it's getting late mami, your screen saver say tweet
So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend
His name Kweli
(You mean Talib, lyrics stick to your rib)
I mean
(That's my favorite CD that I play in my crib)
I mean
(You don't really know him, why is you lying)
You Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line
She's gonna think that I'm lying, just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high


Yeah, I can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes
But never mind, I need some tracks you trying to pull tracks out
And my rhymes is finna blow you trying to blow backs out
Well OK, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm, aiyyo
Ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your mom?
She's the bomb, but she got the boujee behavior
Always got something to say like an OK player hater
Anyway, I don't usually fuck with the Internet
Or chicks on Birth Control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fucking that much, you trying to get off cigarettes
And she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the bubble kush and a sister could get a hit of it


Get 'em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke
A high filled with dope
You all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes
The real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find like a remote control,
Rap is not a used to but still got love,
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs, it's like Tiger Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show
Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, niggas in you
You's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead
I'm here to resurrect me, mosh is too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured MCs, and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to copping her
Album, how come, you the hot garbage of
The year, It's clear your image is snooped up
Label got you souped up, telling you you're sick
Man you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster
Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga
Read the infa, red across your head Imma bred King like Simba
Boulder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a MC with a temper
You dancing for money like honey, I did this my way

>> chamillionaire

 "Mixtape Messiah".......Da King is here nigga!





Ay what these other niggaz talkin', I don't believe that shit

I'm the King cuz I said it and I mean that shit

Ay I'm the king cuz I said it, I'm the king cuz I said it

I'm the king cuz I said it and I mean that shit

Ay what these other niggaz talkin', I don't believe that shit

I'm the King cuz I said it and I mean that shit

Ay what's so special bout him, he ain't all that, shit

I set the city on fire and you seen that shit





Stupid you runnin' around like the Messiah isn't a force

Then tell me how did my first album even get on The Source

I was sittin' next to Pimpin' Ken, (was he pimpin'?), of course

But I was thinkin' bout gettin' with Trina and tryna pimp me a Porsche

I can't hand a nigga the rap game now cuz I'm usin' it

Ain't a underground rapper gon' have it til' I through with it

I don't burn bridges (nah), other rappers 'll ruin it

I just jump over the bridge and pimp-slap em' for doin' it

I'ma embarass ya so bad, that ya label gon' say they know ya

You's a good ass promoter, but the fat lady say it's over

Mixtape Messiah 2 is the bullet I'm savin' for ya

And I can pop trunk pumps on ya coffin' and raise it for ya (Weww!)

And I ain't the only person who sick of ya voice

I kill a rapper with one verse and the real niggaz rejoice

But I was forced (do you feel any remorse?) of course

That's why I'ma show up at his funeral and pop trunk on his corpse









Yeah, you'll never get on my level, no need to go get a ladder

You better run when I come like a pitcher that hit the batter

(You Paid In Full?), nah, but I got alot of respect for Hatter

Even though niggaz be ignorin' my questions bout business matters

Cat tell me to call Hatter, Madd Hatter said call Cat

I call niggaz about some business, and I never get a call back

I just wanted my songs back, but they act like I'm on crack

To drop another Cham' & Paul, we ain't even on contract

Parta' the game is that, I keep gettin' reminded daily

Labels ahead 'll screw you, that's the business out of it baby

Nigga was grindin' daily, but suspicions was kinda crazy

I had to pretend like I was broke, just to get Paid In Full to pay me

It's crazy, for the label with the reputation for actin' a ass

Like Rap-A-Lot, what's the label that was always on time with cash

Gave em' my price, they didn't try to make me go down a tag

So for J.P., Tom, Rad, and Chief, it's done they ain't gotta ask

Ain't a nigga who can persuay me to go back to House

So I can hear Dike Jones tell me he got platinum in his mouth

That nigga soft, he ain't never move no crack in the South

Was in packagin' soft, and he said he stack more stacks then the Boss

Sure you do, I hope that's not a story they told to you

You need to pimp-slap that sick pup and maker who controllin' you

You ain't runnin' NOTHIN'!, only you would go vote for you

Cuz my pockets got more G's, then a G-Unit quotable

G-G-G-G-G-G-Geez, you's a pee-on please

Why is he here somebody please, tell this pee-on leave

Air-condition on my wrist, I stay with free-on sleeves

Ya stay on D, like defenders durin' three-on-three's

My momma moved out the hood to a 5 bedroom home

Rasaq moved off to solo and got a lil' crib of his own

Then I bought a Ninja bike and another whip on chrome

My money long, I stand on top of the world and spit on Jones

Your album, so what we heard you was comin' soon

Yeah the song with Alicia Keys, or maybe you said it was Loon

I can fit your crib inside my truck, and I'd still have leg-room

Then I can park that whole truck inside my Master Bedroom

Saw ya DVD you talkin' that ridiculous noise

Sister got kids with baby cribs bigger then yours

Danny DeVito duckin' down couldn't even fit through your doors

You gotta be Kiddin' me BOY!, is you Kiddin' you SURE! (SURE!)












I step in the club, and I'm throwin' up my set

Cup-Cup at the bar, and ??

I got special effects surroundin' my neck





No-No you don't nigga, Dike Jones just got wrecked

When I step in the club, you breakin' yo neck

You know why I'm here, to take my respect

You can't get next, I came to plex

So call up Dike Jones and tell him he just got wrecked





Hoe ass niggaz, guess I gotta remind you

All them hoe ass niggaz, guess I gotta remind you







Hoe ass nigga..I tryed to let that nigga slide..man

Got respect for Watts and the House man

But nah man, hoe ass nigga, niggaz gotta get dealt with man

Out there bumpin' they gums, talkin' all that noise nigga





-It's King Koopa..ay

I got em' scramblin', I know he feel the pressure to cheat

But I can handle him, that hoe gon' show respect to the chief

He the King of Who?, King of What?, Sesame Street

I lay you out over some beef like some sesame seeds

Meet you half-way, it's like I'm interceptin' ya beef

Await on my front-lawn, like I'm expectin' ya beef

I know that Dike Mike, wanna turn the plex into piece

But I can't (Why?), I threw away my weapon reciept

I'm bout to get him, just when he thought Koopa was in neutral

Scrap or keep it on wax, don't matter whatever suits ya

I don't know Dre, but ay I wouldn't introduce ya

I drop a beat down on ya ass like a producer

Future?, nah cuz I won't let you have next

I bet he e-mail me and try to send me internet threats

Go and pop some damn X, go and pop some Zanex

Do something better with ya life and go and have some hand sex

You ain't bringin' Cham' plex, you on a pharmaceutical

What type of fool is you? I'ma suit you for your funeral

A bunch of niggaz hit me sayin' what they wanna do to you

Don't worry, I won't let em' shoot at you, until I through with you





I step in the club, and I'm throwin' up my set

Cup-Cup at the bar, and ??

I got special effects surroundin' my neck





No-No you don't nigga, Dike Jones just got wrecked

When I step in the club, you breakin' yo neck

You know why I'm here, to take my respect

You can't get next, I came to plex

So call up Dike Jones and tell him he just got wrecked





Hoe ass niggaz, guess I gotta remind you

All them hoe ass niggaz, guess I gotta remind you







Hoe ass nigga..shoulda known that nigga was fraud man

Niggaz was tellin' me that that nigga was fraud, and I was defendin' that

nigga man

Shoulda known better man, should seen it, should seen it comin'

Fraud ass nigga, gotta new name nigga, Dike Jones!





-Yeah!

Chamillionaire the biggest threat to any nigga that think he doin' it

I gave you life, but I'll take it back, before your through with it

I gave you plenty chances, but now it's over you ruined it

Swishahouse before you, and Koopa was your influence kid

You was on Tidwell, tryna slang me your raps

Got in the game, and then you switched it to slangin' some crack

I ain't a pussy trust that, it ain't no thang to attack

And it ain't no thang to react, the heater sang and go clap

Ain't no explainin' for that, you get lit up like a candle

Give you more then a sample, bet that nigga get trampled

Make that dike an example, kiddie clubs gonna ban you

They gon' have to cancel his show on the disney channel

He hated on Magno, see people never noticed him

he talked down on his boy to me, while doin' shows with him

Said the streets ain't feelin' him, how could you even know it

when you got your wack ass rap style from Nickolodean

Who? Dike Jones, Who? Dike Jones

Wrote his name and his number on the Swishahouse stone

Who? Dike Jones, Who? Dike Jones

Ain't with ya team but still the King of the Swishahouse throne





I step in the club, and I'm throwin' up my set

Cup-Cup at the bar, and ??

I got special effects surroundin' my neck





No-No you don't nigga, Dike Jones just got wrecked

When I step in the club, you breakin' yo neck

You know why I'm here, to take my respect

You can't get next, I came to plex

So call up Dike Jones and tell him he just got wrecked

(Dike Jones, Who?, Dike Jones, Jones)





Yeah, I end the heat like a pizza man

Dike Jones, is a wack rapper but he isn't a bad promoter

You don't know want problems my nigga

my stats is way past a quarter

Cuz I'm gettin' what Flipper says in the initial that's after Clover, G's

Nigga please, them commercials ain't even right (why)

Texas niggaz be pourin' purple, we been don' remixed that Sprite

Okay Koopa stick to this Dike, you right if he wanna fight

But this ain't no Lil' Flip beverage he won't have a Lucky Night (nah)

He lucky if he have a life, sayin' Cham' ain't gon' get a deal

Ain't no rhymer you's a vagina, it's time for some Vagisil

Want problems then Crank It Up, ain't no Static or Banner here (nigga)

I crush that lil' man career, like a Budweiser can of beer

Bout to dig up a deep hole, so ya album can rest and sleep

You can put all ya lyrics in it the gimmicks can rest in peace (Who?)

I bought ya CD, you was sayin' how you the best in the streets (Uh-Uh)

So I had to go get my quarterback like niggaz who step in them cleets

Hut 1, Hut 2, now you in some trouble fool

And my brother don't like you now, you got trouble in doubles dude

And you won't get to guzzle juice, no opening for ya food

Cuz the only way to shut you up, is a muzzle to muzzle you

Watch the punisher punish WHO?, nah, I don't have to ask ya

You said it, now you gon' get it, and I ain't gon' have a hassle

You ain't the King, I should know I'm the nigga that built the castle

I pull my back-hand and slap you, turn you 'to a dizzy rascal (WHO!)

That ain't hip-hop, I swear that garbage gon' get stopped

I'ma kill the tick-tock you got in your flea-market wrist-watch (Fuck that nigga)

He said I fell off, and Koopa could never get hot

Can't pull my dick out, cuz he got my dick in a lip-lock

Man, I'm just sayin' though get off my genetalia

Get off my nuts, I'm bettin' ya, no you ain't no competitor

Mo' money and mo' money record sales, etcetera etcetera

So I'ma delete you, and put Magno back there instead of ya (OH!)





Now who they want?

...Now who they hate

Real niggaz ain't jammin' no

(Dike Jones, Who?, Dike Jones, Jones)


Mix Tape Messiah..





Yeah uh-huh, Chamillitary mayn, Chamillitary mayn

And I mean that there, and I mean that there

And I mean that there, yeah-yeah

Yeah-yeah-yeah, and I mean that there

And I mean that there, and I mean that there yeah-yeah





Not a angel I'm filled with anger, to the industry I'm a danger

They make friends with dick suckers, said they tell you that I'm a stranger

Kick some dirt on my name, but really how can I blame you

I'm the next to blow, so they put me on punishment for bad behavior

They said I should of went major, but I'm a procrastinator

I get the job done playa, but I'm busy now ask me later

Stay with a calculator, my lawyer get a grand retainer

Why cause I'm a better business man, than your average hater

But now I wanna ask a favor, don't talk to me like I'm stupid

Got no love for you haters, so send that message to cupid

Give a shout out to Who Kid, (why give a shout out to Who Kid)

Cause I'm wearing something, that match the size of a G-Unit shoe kid

What's that a nine stupid, you do the math why

I tried to be nice to the dyke, but that was my last try

And since it seems the industry, is infatuated with the bad guy

I'm spitting and pissing on gimmick niggaz, when they pass by

Get mad that I get green, you dealing with the Hulk

I put my anger in the music, nigga this is the result

Did a hundred thousand independent, now I move c.d.'s in bulk

Check on Chamillionaire.com, my fan base is a cult

I'm that nigga that'll spot you, see you in the streets and box you

You acting like you a problem, I bet I do something bout you

Run the South when it come to making mix tapes, I'm a monster

Napster crashed, but I wanna give a special shout out to Kazaa

Long as Lil' Jon, and Manny keep making beats

Chamillionaire gon be a ghetto millionaire, in these streets

I speak my mind, so stop acting so sentimental

You soft, if you go to jail you'll get used for a prison pillow

You scared, shooting slugs behind the bushes and not a brick

Like a bush is gon protect you, you know who you dealing with

Chamillitary hideous mood, and I pity the fool

If I walk in I bet every sissy, in the city'd move

Ain't got to walk a city for food, like Diddy did dude

If you hungry for drama, I'll see that my Semi get chewed

Give me the tool I'm from Texas, but I ain't no damn bammer

Mess with Killa Mike, Ron Thomas that Quo down in Atlanta

Lil' Flip and my man Banner, come here and get man handled

By Slim, E.S.G., OG Ron C fix your damn channel

If you think we all right thurr, and speaking with bad grammar

I know Bun B, Lil' O and S.U.C. ain't no damn bammers

Rasaq ain't no damn bammer, Play-N-Skillz ain't no damn bammers

The clip in the hand jammer, to use it for a damn hammer

Hit you on top of your head, and leave humps like a tan camel

Keep a couch with a full house, like Dan Tanner

That's plenty of bricks, that's plenty of chips

There's plenty of fine groupies, there's plenty of chicks

Like dominatrix chicks, there's plenty of whips

So you bricks can do a flip, off the end of my dick

Get off the end of my tip, nigga you a crash test dummy

You album dropped you smile and frown, after the math get funny

I'm getting all my publishing, never had that kept from me

I'm buying Color Changin' vehicles, with my ass cap money

Promises that they gave you, made you feel like you major

Navigator and two-way pager, they gave you then made you

Go lie about how they paid you, and never will play you

You's a puppet go get a refund, I think that they played you

You album was whack huh, it's still on the rack huh

Repo man hopped in your vehicle, they took it back huh

You go get a dagger, then hop in a cab huh

You looking for a A&R or CEO, you can stab huh

Did a hundred thousand independent, ain't really nothing to prove

I make a million disappear, quicker than Nelly with jewels

See the industry wouldn't listen, so I stopped being a humble guy

Now I'm the come get it, if you ready to royal rumble guy



And I mean that there, and I mean that there

And I mean that there jeah, (throw you out the game)




Why, you are still are talking lies

Don't they know I will ride

And make somebody slide

Be with it

Why, you are still are talking lies

Don't they know I will ride

And make these busters hide

Be with it

We run the game, run, we run the game

Run the game, game, try to scandalise my name

We run the game, run, we run the game

Run the game, game, try to scandalise my name





Shoulda seen it coming baby

Shoulda seen it coming nigga

Yo, yo

We running the game nigga, I'ma run you out the game nigga

I ain't gonna let no pussy niggas represent my city nigga

Nuh uh, especially not no gimmick pussy niggas

Yeah





We real niggas, we ride chrome, we don't listen to the Jones

We give a damn whether you like him or whether he pick up his phone

Smoking cigars on album covers, that nigga thinking he Capone

Who the hell is gassing him up? They got him sipping on Patron

(That was wrong) I mean petroleum, roll with him, wouldn't try

You'd step over to the side and sit it down if you was wise

Dyke Jones just died, "Chamillion, what is your reply?"

Must of did like my door handles and committed suicide

(Is that right) Messed up cause his thing used to be an anthem

But I only think you pussy when I hear it like a tampon

He'll be working at the dam pond, now I don't drive a Phantom

With the money I make offa this CD I'll probably grab one

Damn, tell me why you had to do that Cham

Cause I don't give a damn how many shows he doing man

I bring beef outside the club like biggity boot that man

And that's 32 chambers less than the Wu-Tang Clan, yep

Four featers, two peoples you already know

Swishahouse ain't gotta screw you cause you already slow

I wasted time chopping, came up wit him at his show

And he was like I gotta go, "I gotta go snitch on Magno"

Don't step up to the throne, you know you need to back down

Mixtape Messiah 2, I'ma give the streets your whole background

Funny looking rap clown, they gonna look at all your raps now

And say "Dyke Jones!" how hilarious does that sound?

He took me off, I ain't tripping, different versions of the song

But that's cool, Dyke Jones isn't gonna be tipping long

Cause he didn't call for back up, too bad he didn't have his phone

That nigga didn't have to roam, that nigga shoulda stayed at home







"See I'm sheriff around these parts and umm

In my neck of the woods, we don't allow too many dykes

Nope, my trusty little musket right here says that uh

You got ten seconds to get outa Georgia or you gonna be dodging bullets

One... three... ten...



Yee-hah"




Color Changin' Click, ay man I still ain't drop a solo album yet

Nah no need to be excited about that

Cuz you gon' have to deal with me

and that whole C.C.C

Real with me, you better be

The industry is scared of me

These pussy niggas ain't sell they'll get signed instead of me

Now toss me the basketball like they want to find out my hops

Nah I'ma different type of baller, our wrist got 5000 rocks

Don't slang but if I did, wouldn't have to hide out from cops

I'd have watchers on the roof, and I would find all they spots

Nah I'm not with Swishahouse ain't no plex with '5000' Watts

But Color Change bought me a platinum grill and a 5000 watch

Sho' ain't low no more it's gon' be 5000 watch

While they open the door for fans and let about 5000 watch

Party starts when I'm steppin' in

I'll trust no one but my next of kin

If you lookin for friends that'll stab ya back

gotta couple friends I'll recommend

Get cash niggas better hit the pen'

Drunk ass niggas better sip the gin'

D-Bo niggas that'll hit ya chin

wait til' you get up and then get ya wind

Tryed to play my click left but then the checks crept-in

And I realized that me, myself and I my best weapons

So I'm rippin' up applications for a next best friend

And the only next that I'ma trust, is my next of kin

Doors closed but we ain't outside yellin' let us in

Attention, little kids

Homie have no fear, the Messiah's here

We gon shut it down, this year yeah





A.N.I. out in Cleveland, Eminem out in taller

Lucky Music in Abilene, waiting for my arrival

Music City in V.A., say hey ain't nobody tighter

Super Sounds in Atlanta, like where that Mix Tap Messiah

Colorado fa sho, they say that Koopa's on fire

Ask James at Eackazam, he'll tell you I'm no liar

Been in the game for a minute, I'm one of the biggest suppliers

I'm the rapper they waiting for, you the rapper they tired of

How the hell you say you blew up so quick, and then rub it in

When you ain't seen a royalty check, and know nothing bout publishing

I feel sorry for the thirteen year old teenagers, who loving him

They try to tangle with the sharks but I'm sorry, he doesn't swim

I'ma rip off another limb, no need for partici-hating

I suggest that you get to shaking the spot, and just switch locations

I wouldn't stop if he told me, if him and Clark Kent was dating

Cause he couldn't spit hotter than me, if that pussy was kissing Satan

I know the public is waiting, for Controversy to sell

Most of the rest of the real niggaz locked, and ain't made bail

Pimp, Z-Ro, 50/50 locked up behind jail

Cause of snitch figga ass niggaz, like Dike Jones trying to tell

Who (hell naw), who (hell naw)

He told me a different story, then the one he trying to tell y'all

Who (hell naw), who (hell naw)

I don't wan' diss my old dog, so I'ma chunk a deuce for Paul

Who told DSR, that he make more than me and P

And my nigga Slim Thee, Dike Jones could it be

You could of praised my whole body, and couldn't afford a sleeve

I don't even drop a c.d., and still clear more than forty G's

A month and it's just my check, and ain't even got to my savings

The money the bank is saving, plus the money my safe is saving

Let's flame him, since he say that he blazing

He blew up quick, and nobody was there to save him

Keep it cool I tried to, but you know I'm a rider

Get respect in Louisiana, and all the way down to

Florida DJ Smallz, Atlanta with DJ Drama

Off this money I make, I'll probably go hit the Bahammas

Get respect in Cali, Vallejo they popping collars

Get respect of the streets, you get respected to tollers

So what I'm trying to say is, I'ma be here regardless

I'm the rapper they waiting for, you the rapper they tired of





Tha-thank you Chamillion, um

You hear it here first, at WKTB work your booty

Pimp radio station, and um

And we have a couple of artists here, that feel the same way

You get put in duct tape, you cupcake you too soft

Ain't no rapper got broke off, this hard since Tha Boss



I've seen your chain, but how much did it cost

You can't be like E.S.G., and let your body defrost

What would you do?

If he was hating on you and never to you

He gon' make sure that he don't bump into you

He gon' pretend he don't see and never knew you

And just avoid you

What would you do?

If everythang he was saying wasn't truthful

He gon' pretend that he ain't did nothing to you

See you can love me or hate, whatever suits you

But I'll destroy you, and you know it! Nigga





Nigga knew he had messed up when he put me on his DVD at the front

Nigga put me in the footage like I'm co-signing this nigga running the game

What type of disrespect is that?

I knew you that messed up nigga, caught you red handed with all your feminine ways

Running round, talking all that noise behind my back

and wasn't man enough to say it to my face man

Real type of nigga you is man

Should of known you was that broad ass nigga that everybody was saying you was

What type of hoe ass nigga talk down on his own click

What type of hoe ass nigga don't say it to a nigga face

And when he see ya he start smiling and shaking hands

A hoe ass nigga, a fraud ass nigga

You gonna have to take it how it hit you nigga

Cause I mean every word that I say on this CD nigga

You know what I'm saying?

Standing on my own two feet like always and I ain't really tripping offa anybody else

Vo, D-R-A-K-E
We Them Boys Came To See (Get Busy Ya)
Ya We Take It To The Same Degree
So Let Loose Cuz You Came (Get Busy Ya)



Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do


Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'
A lot of rappers in my city, they ain't saying nothin'
A lot of records from here they get no play
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay
Them little rims on the ride, I'mma let those stay
So these nosy niggas won't know that I get checks all day
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying on guessing
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it
Boi-1da and Drake if there's beef I address it
And the black Phantom is here soon as we find our exit
Both of the deals, nothing under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro, I'mma teach you beginners
Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer
For features ya'll better get me while its cheaper than dinner
Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats I'mma sell her




Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you
And I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now
But I was here along your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed,  and I write a sixteen and record it
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
They expectations I'mma exceed it
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here I'mma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin for cash
And purchase so fast, you only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like I'm listening to all Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy




Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to kick some new school lines
And so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death
Now not signing me is something that the rest regret
Then I, hopped inside the Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back





Southern Smoke {echo}
It's Southern Smoke baby!
(Money) Frank 
(Money) My man Nickelus F
(Money) Ho! It's Drake. Southern Smoke
(Money) This is the remix right here
(Money) So if you got some (Money)
Put ya hands in the air
(Money) Southern Smoke


Now-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled
(Right) Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve
This ain't Brad Pitt, I gotta admit
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, cause it's a bad fit
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy
So, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy!


I, take time arrange that (Money)
Some, kill just to claim that (Money)
Switch countries exchange that (Money)
You cannot get jack for freeee

And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's, no need to stash right (Money)
Got the same, 4 g's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from meeeee, homie

Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast 'cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm tryna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?

Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast 'cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm tryna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many 
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this HIP HOP
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the PIT STOPS
I heard the prize was some chicks and a WRIST WATCH
And all you gotta do is go to jail or GET SHOT
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put it in the heart of Pickering
And tell them niggas this is NICK'S SPOT
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh



It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

I'm tryna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM


Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane 
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina go rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth 10 degree, Tennekey, T Dot to the country ya'll
Orangemen and White Haven, an back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
 Light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap
 Pass the torch and sell they soul 
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't tryna hear that
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they  to get respect
This can't be life, dominoes and  dro and twenty stacks


Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jack rabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!


It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit

Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM




This the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin

Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin

Chasin fat stacks, runnin down grands and submission

I don't back track, every single sound for me different

I don't own no ice, just got clean rap

Don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap

We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up

Anybody I'm standin beside's all bossed up

Burgular ? they say I'm servin them rhymers

And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes

I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater

With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater uh

I got the diamonds in my teeth flow

Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my *chopped voice* speech slow

Peep though, I only got pity for you lames

Sitting pretty in the game, in the city that I claim





Yo, the city is mine (which one?)

T-O-R-O-N-T-O

D-R-A-K-E that's me

You know how the story goes

Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll

And I play myself in the stereo

And I make 'em wanna 

Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it

Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it

Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!





Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard

Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power

Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip

Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip

So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip

And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip

And it's a trip, my city broke into sections

Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections

And it's nothing that I created on purpose, there's people that gotta problem

But they scared to let it surface, uh

Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em

See me out and they never utter a word to 'em

Expect me not to draw a card from the deck

Anybody in my city going hard I respect but,

You gotta debt and you choose not to pay that

Imma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh

It ain't a problem of concern bruh, I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh

This ain't last year, money like a cashier, so hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh

Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine

And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line

And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of

And if anybody hatin on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy





Yo, the city is mine (which one?)

T-O-R-O-N-T-O

D-R-A-K-E that's me

You know how the story goes

Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll

And I play myself in the stereo

And I make 'em wanna 

Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it

Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it

Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!



Break it down, break it break it down

Break it down, break it break it down

Break it down, break it break it down

Break it down, break it break it down

Break it down

And Promoters'll Push Flyers
Money Exchange Hands
Liars Sell You They Dreams
And Dummies Exchange Plans
Hustlers Give You Events
Bouncers Give You Pass
Directors Give Em A Shot
So Girls'll Give Up The Ass

And Groupies That Would Flock To Hometown Athletes
And Start Rolling Together Like Snoopy And Woodstock
Daffy And Bugs, Its All Laughing And Hugs

And She Back Where She Was
Right Back On The Bus
Its Ashame Cuz Now At His Rental
She Throwin Bricks Like Shaq In The Clutch

Cuz He Doesnt Hold Her
Fall Flat On The Ground Trying Ta Lean On His Shoulder

And Im One Of Em, The Other Four You Know Who You Are
But If You Gotta Think Through
Chances Are That It Aint You
I Singlehandedly Carry Out What You Cant Do
And See I Take A Couple Of Breathers
And Then Things Come Together On The Spot Like A Couple Thats Eager
If You Wanna Pack A Duffel And Leave Her
Go Ahead, I Couldnt Give Two Damns Like A Couple Of Beavers
But Uh, The In & The Out

Whenever Im Out In Memphis The Man Seen As Trill
And Every Verse The Man Seem To Kill
You Can Find Him With Black Jays And Socks Like Im Andreena Mill
Japan And Brazil, The Audience Acreaming
And Then You Come Around And All The Fans Seems To Chill
Advances To Deals, Financing Appeals
The Hustles, I Have You Feeling Like You Dancing In Heels And Uh

At Times She A Solid Chick
And Im A Sucka For The Cuties
So She Always Lookin Good When My Wallets Thick

Look This Aint A Song Dissing Half Of These Rappers
Or Pasha And Sasha, Esther Baxter

>> pdiddy









Yeah can you hear me?  Yeah

There's certain things in life that you can stop

and there's certain things in life that can't be stopped

Let's go..



"And now.. for your.. Bad Bad Boys..

Starting at guard.."





Y'all niggaz still talkin?

Oh you got a little name little fame little fortune?

What you have is a portion

Bout the size of the hats in the back of my Porsche and

So you better use caution, knowin I'm the boss and

I'm sittin on pyramids, flossin

I don't really gotta talk son

I can get lost and sit back livin off endorsements

I'm a pro, kid

Why you actin like you don't really know, kid?

Any records I broke it

Through the fame and the stardom, makin my mark on Harlem like Poe did

I said, here's your eviction notice

But you probably already know this

I don't mean to be greedy, but turn on your TV

or pick up your CD, P.D.





This is gruesome

Niggaz always grab that mic and salt like they really gon' do some'

What's wrong with you son?

Oh you got a new gun, do you know how to use one?

Then you livin an illusion, livin in a used one

while I'm in the Limited, cruisin

You ain't really got a crew son

You givin them amusement, fuck what your Comic Views meant

Youse a smokehead

I've been doin this since this Pro-Ked

Broke breads with the cokeheads

Been down, still I get around like a nigga with broke legs on a moped

I said; I'm a "Top Gun" like Gossett

Run and get your CD and cass-ette

Gossip, lotta niggaz got lip

But they ain't got hot yet 'til they got Dep





Why niggaz lie like that?  Know they ain't fly like that

Niggaz get fried like that

And you don't wanna die like that

Have your momma cryin like that

Besides all that, I'm in to get it fryin like that

Still on the block and move pies like that

Never my life dealt with guys that rap

In fact, I leave a nigga with his eyes all sad

Swoll up, y'all niggaz better hold up

Any nigga that roll up, could get fold up

Body get ripped up, and then sewed up

Every nigga I fucked with, niggaz is growed up

We don't play games, get on the stand, and say names

All we do is cock back, and spray planes

Give a fuck if nigga hustle or gangbang

Nigga try to use they muscle and fang fang





Keep frontin, I'ma put a crease in your jaw

Might catch me squeezin the four

My nigga I go to war

And if a nigga want the raw you still gotta come in the store

Y'all never had a run-in before, with the likes of an outlaw

Predicate assassin, smashin

Open shit, rig scope, focus it

Give niggaz what they 'posed to get (shit)

Oppose the clique, I send five close to six

Hoodfellaz, that'll come close your shit

Niggaz stay with the frozen wrists

Now the smoke colored big Benz with the top broke off

Fix your face, we back on the paper chase

Never left, so I ain't gotta take your place

Fuck the fake bogus niggaz that ain't notice

the breadwinner, three-six-five I stay focused nigga





We'll never stop..

We'll never stop..

One of the greatest teams that ever lived..

It's like in our blood..

We gotta be born this way..

Bad Boy baby




Aiyyo, you ready?

Let's do it 

Mmm, yeah, uhh..

Yeah, uhh.. c'mon



I'm the definition of, half man, half drugs

Ask the clubs, Bad Boy - that's what's up

After bucks, crush cruise after us

No gaze, we ain't laughing much

Nothing but big thangs, check the hitlist

How we twist shit, what change but the name?

We still here, you rocking wit the best

Don't worry if I write rhymes, I write checks (ahh!)

Who's the boss?  Dudes is lost

Don't think cause I'm iced out, I'm gonna cool off

Who else but me? (who else?) And if you don't feel me

that mean you can't touch me, it's ugly, trust me

Get it right dawg, we ain't ever left

We just, moved in silence and rep to the death (yeah)

It's official, I survived what I been through

Y'all got drama, "The Saga Continues..."





We ain't, go-in nowhere, we ain't, going nowhere

We can't be stopped now, cause it's Bad Boy for life

We ain't, go-in nowhere, we ain't, going nowhere

We can't be stopped now, cause it's Bad Boy for life





Aiyyo strait from the Harlem streets

I don't play, I push it down wit the Harlem Heat (uh-huh)

All a sudden niggas got a problem wit me (Black, what happened?)

They run around acting like the black don't care eat

And you know what? (what?) For some strange reason (uhh)

I want this medication full of deranged eating

For y'all to put the word out (c'mon, c'mon) we ain't leaving

We trying to be rich before we do stop breathing

Then fall (what?) we kinda hustle lanes

Stay laying down on muscle games (c'mon)

Still turn niggas dreams to flames (yeah)

You got the wire, if not I ain't saying no more names

You soon expire; (heh) no pain (nuh-uh)

I feel remorse, the shit causes me and Diddy up first

Racing Porsches wit the beat swing vaul exhausters  (yeah)

On the cover of ya five (hehe) XXL's or (yeah) Source's (c'mon) bitch









Yeah, yeah, yo, yeah

It ain't shit changed, since the Notorious (We miss you B.I.G.)

See everything still glorious (yeah)

We still got Oreos, still be the victorious (that's right)

See it's a lot of them, but it's more of us

Still got cash to blow, raps that flow

Still them cats that know, pack ya flow

That's fo' sho', bottles that pop

Joints that rock, play the background

Hand 'em a jock, hold 'em a glock (hahaha)

Money to get (yeah), cars to flip (uhh)

Bars to sit at and sip Cognac wit Jews that drink (c'mon)

Hoes to see (uhh), make sure they knowing it's me (they know ya shit)

Drop that beat, can't believe that I MC (haha)

Bad Boy 'til the casket drop (Bad Boy)

Gotta love it, place nuttin above it (nuttin)

It's on like that (c'mon), don't believe, we ain't going like that

We're always gonna be here (yeah)

We there (uhh) every motherfucking year!









Bad Boy.. we ain't going nowhere

Uh-huh.. uh-huh.. what?

We ain't going nowhere.. we gonna stay right here

For ever, and ever, and ever, and ever.. c'mon

We ain't going nowhere.. we gonna stay right here

We ain't going nowhere.. we gonna stay right here

Cause it's Bad Boy for life!

Attack like a Rottweiler 

But worse den a Rottweiler 

Cause da Rottweiler soft





Really, get smacked silly, you get smacked silly

Fucking with these niggas from the, what you gonna do

When you ready, shit I was born ready, 

And I was all ready on fish and spaghetti

Creep with the culture, rap I can coach ya

Attack like a vulture, see what I told ya

Said I'd get cha, wear it if it fit ya

Y'all thirteen inches, I see the big picture

If it's to get richer, I'd probably get wit ya

If not burn it, get hot like a furnace 

Shoot the video, motherfuck city permits

We own the city, on the phone with Diddy (*phone sounds*)

Red bone pretty, when she get aroused like to suck her own titty

Put it in the video

Ya wanna holla got to follow nigga here we go

Get you ticket, the train, don't miss it

Won't reach out, and ya bet I won't visit

Till my whole wardrobe is-it, now listen







Make this money

Take this money (Let's get it)

Ain't no way you can take this from me (Let's get it)

Ain't shit funny (uh)

Shake it honey (Let's get it)

Take it money

Now let's get it (Let's get it)





Creep with your people

Though my shit is Sweet and Low it's no Equal, front but you lookin

Once I throw the hook you proceed to get cookin

With the game when the soldiers shit

you came, thought that I owed you one

Wide big Lincoln, why's this guy on the side for the stinking?

Watch task force dash forward lookin marveled

It's a big chance, big pants, might guard him 

with my man's type cargo

Better learn quick, cause my clique don't argue 

You ain't my crew, who are you?  Beat it

'Fore we take off make sure you all seated

Billboard read it believe it









Soul Controller, rap Ayatollah

Kids hate me when they older I put cracks by the stroller

I'm registered voter, motherfuck a quota

Give some bakin soda and a quarter

Bet I flow straight up out the water

I'ma wreck the game til it say out of order

Put the high score up, then tear the floor up

On the world tour with your whore out in Europe, head on the tour bus

Do what them niggaz in the drop thinks cooler

All the five quarters, headline supporters, 

Hitting wives and daughters

Brought a neck spray from Estee Lauders

Call Puffy to order





Aiyyo, call me Diddy, I run this city

Send the cops, the D.A. and feds to come get me

Cats wanna leave me for dead you comin with me

Gettin head in the Bentley red at one fifty

Straight lose it, love two things my money my music

Might co-write and produce it

Drop mine, hot 9 exclusive

Got y'all Hulkin like Bruce did

Cause I can, break backs and stacks it's no problem

Make raps and tracks and go Harlem

I get worldwide coverage

I got so many spots I don't even buy luggage, ya love it

Make moves major, hide out in Asia, 

If your girl keep coming around them I'm a blaze her

I'm the Bad Boy flavor, light blue gators

NOT GUILTY, plus I'm filthy, c'mon









I be the east side Soprano, Rob Marciano

Flow in each channel with the Iverson handle

Forty-five sparks turn your day gray flannel

Snatch the yay of the mantle, then proceed to dismantle

Can't slay Rob

How many niggas done tried to play mob, quit they day job

Tired of putting broke niggas under the wing

If I go to jail again I'm going under the bing

Act like you gonna pull that thing thing

You the only one that always get stuck for bling bling

I represent "A" block in Sing Sing

Almost caught a buck fifty for fuckin a Latin King's queen

Moves for paper, booze no chaser

Bullets out the blazer four-fifths with laser

Come and get your shit splitted, newspapers say I did it

(He ain't do it) Now let's get it (Let's get it) 






Yeah

Its Bad Boy Baby

Neptunes

And we won't stop

(I like that) 'Cause we can't stop

Yeah

Let me tell you something





Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick

I was on 1-2-5 and Saint Nich

Chillin' with these chick

Named Tondalea

Was a hot girl and everybody wanted to slay her

She wasn't fond of players

Only wanted ballers

To spoil her

Six figures and camcorders

So what you trying to tell me dear

I got Bentley, Benz send in Mr. Belvedere

I just want to blow your mind

I'm talkin' literally blow your mind

My repratoir is Menage Trois

And exotic cars chilling with the hottest stars

And it ain't no stopping this

I can't help it I'm an optomist

And Ima make ya head bop to this

And at the end you gon rock to this

Now say my name





Its the D the I the D the D the Y

It's Diddy, (Hold Up) It's Diddy (That's crazy)

It's the D the I the D the D the Y

The D the I the D

Its Diddy, (Hold Up), It's Diddy (Say What!)





Ay yo, I came in the door

I said it before

I never the ladiez hyptonize me no more

But, back to the manuscript

'Cause I don't think you can handle this

From New York to Los Angles

I think the whole world scandalous

I'm just trying to keep the candles lit

Make the party people dance to this

Get out your seat and clap your hands to this

Cause I came too far

For me to be bouswar

It's a Bently to you, to me it's a blue car

So Branson pass me a jar

Cause these cats done went too far

One phone call send two cars

And still get searched by security guards

I guess that's what I have to do

Take the game international

Now what you call me







(La La La La La La La La La La La La)

C'mon work it out girl

I'm trying to see you work it out girl

(La La La La La La La La La La La La)

C'mon work it out girl

I wanna see you work it out girl





Now hold up, stop, wait a minute

We don't stop we rock cause ain't a limit

My aim is winning

Got asian women

That'll change my linen

After I done blazed and hit em

But I just wanna rock wit you

And take it straight to the top with you

And do what I gots to do

If it's possible

Cause I ain't trying to stop you boo

I got an agenda

Got on a ninja

One wheelin' and killin' it not to offend ya

That's when I met this chick named Brenda

Tender, her whole body bend like fender

So let me see you shake it girl

I just wanna see you shake it girl

For the return of the don

The world in my palm

My mom calls me Sean

But y'all call me





(La La La La La La La La La La La)

C'mon work it out girl

(La La La La La La La La La La La)

I wanna see you work it out girl




Yeah...

Yeah, me and my man's and them

We gon' blast off

Bad Boy nigga, and we don't stop

Come on to the top, blast off

Yeah, yo



Aiyyo, I take it up top for my peeps

Cracks in they Jeeps, don't sleep till they 6 feet deep

No 'lax' in my tracks they potent

Fuck homicide, I'ma ride, keep smokin'

I keep smokin' till the bullshit filter

Like cigarettes, Dep came through, killed ya

When I swerve hit nerves

Number 1 contenders, I put 'em on injured reserve

And everybody know what's golden, matter of fact platinum, 

?mores trap to mold in?

Once I explode and I, burn up the road and

Cruise around the globe, the cops thinkin' it's stolen

Understand, the world's in my hand

G. Dep in this scam, no stunt

Bitch play the front

And I'ma show you how to lay back do a buck while you puff on a sac

Cause yo, I'm about to blast off -



Straight to the chase, cause everybody know what's the case

Aiyyo, I'ma about to blast off

Straight to the point, aiyyo, yo, light another joint

Nigga, I'ma blast off

Right to the top, aiyyo, no, I ain't gon stop yo

Nigga, I'ma blast off

Straight to the dome, you entered in the Bad Boy zone





Yo, yo, uh

Who's a nigga harder than me?

On the boats, make it known how the slaughterin' be

Damn, Curry ain't the shit? Put the name in your mouth

Got it different? You ain't on what you talkin' about

Bustin' off in her mouth, catch me

I'm feelin' for whoever test me, pity for whoever second guess me

Know how to ?manhand'? it's real as it get

Feelin' my shit, straight through the cealin' with this

Bet your block love it, find me only with the grimy

Gutters of the street where my mind be

Play the game, get you a 'zil'

Forever, put you until, it fit me to kill

Heat, got it with me still

Flip the game over, see me, we be, untouched

Out like your motherfuckin' guns bust, BLAOW

Sure shot, hit again, spit it grim, anytime, anyplace

Bitch, I'm about to-





Blast off, yo I get it poppin'

When I rock, yo it's non-stoppin'

Yo, I'm about to blast off

See me at the show, when I rock everybody know

Aiyyo, I'm about to blast off

Bottles gon' pop, cause when I rock, everybody rock

Aiyyo, I'm about to blast off

Straight to the top, cause everybody know this is hot





Aiyyo son, I'm about to blast off, like an astronaut

Niggas don't wanna see a nigga blast the glock

Niggas don't wanna see a nigga flash the rocks

And pop up in the flashy drop - motherfuckers

Niggas know me, Loon's a gunslinger

Fuck fightin' a nigga, I'm usin' one finger

Catch one of you rap cats in the 'Humdinger'

Some niggas get shot, live and become singers

Expect to die, I'd rather sit in a chair, electrified

Than to stand here and testify

But, other than that though, we never get caught

We ?Joy Jefferson? walk, out of federal court

We gettin' bread in New York, ain't better the sport

So whatever you thought, you can use whatever support

But, I think it's best you go 'head and just walk

Or have the cops find traces of lead in your corpse

Yo, I'm about to-





Blast off-

Straight to the chase, cause everybody know what's the case

Aiyyo, I'ma about to blast off

Straight to the point, aiyyo, yo, light another joint

Nigga, I'ma blast off

Right to the top, aiyyo, no, I ain't gon stop yo

Nigga, I'ma blast off

Straight to the dome, you entered in the Bad Boy zone




Yeah.. uh-huh, uh-huh-huh..

Yeah





Yeah, yeah

This big 'Ball mayn, P. Diddy and MJG

We raw mayn (we raw) if pimp was a drug we'd O.D. (c'mon)

Got game for days - betta keep yo' broad away from a nigga like me

I likes to play (I likes to play)

Drop the top and feel the summer breeze (let's go)

I know you can get with that, flippin through the city

I'm thuggin off in my house out in Cleveland 
Weeded, I'm sleepin', P.O.D.'ed 
Dozed off, but I was awakened by the telephone ringin' 
I picked it up 
Hello? At first, nobody would answer me, so I said it again 
Hello? Somebody starts breathin' 
Not thinkin', I hung up the phone 
Niggas be playin' jokes, I payed it no mind 
It could've been just my fuckin' friends 
Then I sat back and closed my eyes
no more than four seconds, it rung again 
Hello?   And why in the fuck is you playin'? 
Somebody yelled out, "You die!" 
Before I could even reply, 
some nigga jumped right through the window buckin' a pistol 
I jumped out of the chair, grabbed the bullets on the way to the stairs 
Feelin' hot bullets fly over my head 
Thinkin' for sure that I'm gonna be dead 
Scared? Oh yeah! 
So I turned around and ran out the backdoor instead 
Them niggas was steadily buckin' 
Whoever was dumpin', they surely did want me in the red.   
Continued to fled--hit a couple of fences 
Thinkin' 'bout who could have did this? 
Retaliation: I'll handle my business, kill 'em--as God as my witness 
I called up my niggas; they ready for war 
Kill 'em's the way that we even the score 
If you did not come for war, what in the fuck you come here for? 

 
What you niggas be?  Killas . . . 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period 
Bloody, bloody murder . . . 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period 
Killa . . . 

 
Five infrared dots, trail by these steel toes runnin' in your spot

Got your tightest G for ransom 
Maybe unhand 'em and let him go 
Hell no, you shouldn't've chanced it 
It's not essential, got smoked, only deaththreats on your boast 
So take it as a quote, get violent if you see me, loc 
We deadly--step, pay your sins, you'll die a thousand times

You tellin' lies, caught you slippin' up at your Mama's house 
Should've took you out, but I told my homies throw you out

Motherfuck y'all niggas hating on me, hatin' on me no no

Gotta grin but I pin swollen eyes so fuck them crooked, crackin' po-pos

Kick down doors on our goals, don't forget them bowls

Keep business to myself cause it's best if no one knows

I trust no hos and trust no nigga, niggas either

Try to take my weed I got more power than She-Ra

Dirty south diva, I rise like Mya

My high starts coming down I smoke some more and I get higher

La la la, they beat this weed and they set fire

Ganja makes me loose cause I'm live like a wire

I never share attire, keep passing me them things

Let's get 'em! Put that heat to they mouths like some wings

Straight out Decatur, gonna get some cheese and fuck the fame

Straight out Decatur, you got drama you know my name

Now close your eyes and listen to Sleekly rhyme

You got five, I got five, let's go get a dime

Uh, uh





A-T-L! I got to do something to get my point heard (heard)

I put my pen down and let the folks hear my words (words)

Don't call me no joker, don't call me no nerd (nerd)

Cause I be going deeper that the others you heard (heard)

Cause this aint in ya head, bumpin' in ya head knockin' (knockin')

I keep the brothers jockin'(jockin') even though they guns be knockin'

Got to block it, throw my hands up and we dip it up and brawl

Talking all that nonsense, not being heard by me at all (at all)

Nigga in your drawers, I rise but my name's not Mya (Mya)

And I's a tight female, don't need to smoke to get you higher

They beggin' for attention (attention), while I beg to differ (differ)

They nervous when I'm lurking and your body be stiffer

I plot by myself (self), my thoughts so dangerous (-rous)

You gotta be lyrically tight if you wanna hang with us (us)

Can't sit on my ass when I know I must be heard (heard)

My pen's been put down and now my mouth hustle words (words)

(Nigga, nigga, nigga, niggas)





So you can go bring anything you want to (want to, want to)

We can do this however, whenever you want to (you know we got it,got it)

Or we can act the fool if that's what you wan' do

Cause real niggas on the Thugline, Thugline (Thugline, Thugline)

You can bring anything you want to (cause if you want it, we got it)

Or we can act the fool if that's what you wan' do

Cause real niggas on the Thugline, Thugline (Thugline, Thugline)





Little Miss on a passion stabbin', nabbin' niggas

I know how to react

And be the one who peeping out them player haters in the back

And I'm attacking -tacking, yes and I'm relaxin' when I'm HIGH

Krayzie Bone and Relay done hooked up this shit cause my my my

Relay is coming 'round the corner

Better run for cover or you're gonna be a goner

Bet on it nigga

We doin' this shit to get richer quicker

Now pull that trigger

Hittin' the sides of niggas

I raise and peace, it's notorious bitch





Tell me something about any rapper and in a heartbeat I would

Snap at the baddest when I rhyme and Relay up to no good

Rappers should value this beat and in this rhyme game it seem

Aint no other four because we'll straight up bust out the scene

Straight out Decatur where it's grater and it can't get no better

Unless you headed to downtown, the land to go make some cheddar

In everyway and everyday you hear these girls but a rap

Or rhyme, or flow, or just whatever you may call, we gon' snap (snap)



Cleveland and ATL done hooked up, this shit is buck

So nigga what? Krayzie's 'bout to bust

Cleveland and ATL done hooked up, this shit is buck

So nigga what? Krayzie's 'bout to bust





Now you know we can get high (high), so high that's my thing (so high)

Mr. Sawed-off Leatherface the name, thuggish when I claim

Staying away from all these lames

And these player haters steady inflictin' pressure on the brain

But my mentality can't be faded; I play it so fucking smooth

I got my mind just like chess and I concentrate on every move

And every rule that they wrote we break 'em, believe me

That's why so many niggas fall off for flossin'

And going against their boss man

Too many chiefs and no Indians

So when I roll I'm mostly solo

And I know that .44 stay mighty close

Just touch on my door ho and you'll be greeted by heaters

Millimeters pop pop pop pop!

Mo! Thug Mothership presents: Thugline niggas

Bone Thugs-N-Harmony still live niggas

And I got my troopers suited and ready, Relay!

Up in this motherfucker marchin', marchin', marchin', marchin'

Bombing on bitches

People be sayin'

And if you think we playin'

Run up and take your chance to die, it's in your hands

Blow for blow we let these motherfuckers know

They know whether they male or female I don't roll with no ho (no ho)










They call me the "Dummy Man" (man, man, man)

And I'm up early tryina slang my dope 

(I'm the nigga with the biggest rocks)

The fiends...they get awfully mad....(mad, mad, mad)

When they go broke on dope and it's really soap 

(My nigga you ain't never lied)







Up in the morning....and I feel like I don't wanna be livin'

Better off dead without no bread....have you ever felt that feeling?

Unsatisfied, feelin' like you wanna die

When you reach into your pocket and can't even find

Not even enough to go purchase a dime (sack of weed)

But FUCK THAT!  I got "come up" in my blood

Cause it's the "1st of the Month" (nigga what!)

The perfect time to come up

The only problem is: I'm broke and ain't got no dope

But as I was standin' in my bathroom mirror....I looked at the soap

Shit...soap look a little like dope (you scandalous nigga!)

Then, I chopped-chopped up me some counterfeit amphetamines

But wait a minute.....

Wait a minute now...what if they want to taste it?

Think quickly for cash: nigga dash to the kitchen, get the bread bag

Wrap that bread around some soap

Now I got the breadcrumb-dum-dum dope

It might sound funny, but it ain't no joke...

cause doin this shit could get a nigga smoked, mayn

But FUCK IT! Young nigga gotta get them duckets

Hit the medicine cabinet for the final touches...

Orajel for the numbness

Then I hit the corner with a handful of breadcrumbs...

nigga got the dum-dum for ya

And the pump on approach if you say it ain't dope, 

only dealin cause I hate to be sober

Peep, "creep on ah come up", I wait for a fiend to roll up

And walk to the car with my hand on my pistol, 

he showed me the green, said 

"Hold  up...gotta get my stash"

Nigga need a 20...but I got that faded

Lovin these yum-yums, glad I made it; 

I just hope this nigga don't try to taste it!

I dropped him the dummy, he said it was lovely

But as he pulled off, I pinned that he put the rock up in his mouth

(So he gon' come back for his money!)

I pinned that he braked...he skid...

Put it in reverse and he came back quick...

Fiend jumped out and he talkin' all big...

This is what happened to this bit....

We beat him and finished him off, and he never came 'round here no more

Cause a nigga ran into yours truly: poor, and a nigga scored

Lord forgive me but i can't remember (the last time I ate)

Now I gots to go get me a plate, or a bit, now I'm proper

Only spent three dollars and forty-four cents, 

nigga full, now I gotta get bent

Nigga still got sixteen dollars and fifty-six cents...HELL YEAH!

These dum-dums got a nigga off the hook..they got booked, took, shook

Look: got dope but it ain't dope, so I guess you can call me a "crooked crook"

Hey...do you know somebody like me?

I don't think so, cause ain't nobody I see

Down for the crime like I'm down for mine, 

and if I gotta, nigga I cheat 

(cheat)







So fuck with me, I got the chops mayn (chops mayn)

The biggest rocks up on the block mayn (block mayn)

Say fuck with me, I got tha chops mayn (the chopper, choppers)

The biggest rocks up on the block mayn (block mayn)

Nigga, you ask 'em they gon' tell you who the thuggish ruggish
They love us
You hater, I bet you won't say fuck you us to our faces
Bitch, and ball up your knuckles 'cause we can work
Too many niggas be thinkin' that I won't bomb back at ya
Thinkin' I'm a rapper, actor
Think I won't blast 'em?
Shit, I'm always ready to bomb back on bustas
I got my gun
So test me if you're tryin' to prove that you ain't scared to die
Nigga, what?
Who the, who the thugs?
Y'all punk muthafuckas ain't got no nuts
I only be dealin' with real niggas
Them other niggas, they get they ass put in check
When they try to flex and disrespect me
And that's when I gotta get even with niggas, retaliation
I bet I will see you again, and nigga, your day is gon' come
But, man, y'all niggas ain't ready for drama
But I'm a put it on Mama
Nigga, you try run up on me
Then I gotta shot your head off
I'm keepin' a gun on me daily
Cause if you got my niggas' wrong
Then they sure gon' try to take it




As far as 50 greatest emcees ever, they gave me 32
Like they don't know how these dirty judge get thirty
They must be shady baby naw just maybe a stunt
The greatest producers, and didn't mention ?? once?
The greatest groups of all time
Stop you're cryin', sporty, find a shorty
Fucked up by not namin' Naughty
Pass the mask, the glock you faggots better stop
Blaze the page out of 50 If it rock and glock
Tryin' to fuck me I'm a fuck you wearin' rubber
Tell 'em niggas at the mags that I ain't sharin' a cover
Bring troops and boots from chrome coupes to hoops
That's us, like namin' emcees and boostin' passed the news
Run through wussy pussy, and better ya
There's the predator, rhymes to better ya, blah!
Where's the editor?
Once a year proof that they're easy to swallow
And I'll bet you'll have a different view of emceein' tomorrow
Thugs all over the world!




Now I done been all over the nation
Kicked it with real soldiers that's 'bout they paper
Had to be so many of these fakers
Had to quickly shake 'em
Knew what I had to do
Said, "Nigga, look the year is '99"
And I'm dead serious about my business, shit is gettin' ridiculous
They gotta be ready to pop, pop, pop, pop the 9 millimeter
Keep your weapon next to the pocket that you keep your profit in
While we fuckin' with niggas that's naughty
Haters look, saw that Treach and Leather Face
We comin' to get the riot started


Since I been around the cadaver
Gather matters just wait
See I splattered the matter, rat-tat-tat-tat and shoot 'em in shake
See I'm comin' like a rhino
Pass the fine ho
We fucked in Illinois, right outside of Chicago
Got rhymes out the ass so find a lasso
I can either rap, ride, rush, war, riddle, or rastle
Leave in line, the ass-whippins with extra clips
Clips with my nigga Krayze Bone with some thugged-out shit
To my thugs all over the world!






Dedicate this to all the niggas on the streets

Niggas in the hood strugglin

Doin what the fuck they gotta do to make their money

And all the thugs, the hustlas, the gangstas, the playas, pimps

Let's roll, let's roll

(Ghetto love, ghetto love I can feel that ghetto love, ghetto love)





Street people

(People)

All my people be them niggas with an attitude

(We're ready for war)

The street mentality: it's do what you gotta do

(Do what you gotta do)





I dedicate this to the niggas in the hood

(Where they at?  Where they at?  Where they at?)

Keepin it real on the street

Niggas they practice what they preach, stayin true until they D-I-E

Niggas still strong

We keep on bailin through the stress

and all the rest of the shit that's goin on

Speakin of violence, I see, you got to keep a pistol

Cause if niggas think you're rich, you gon be got, they out to pinch ya 

Bullshit you not--killin' because of the pump

And it drives us to the point of no return

Especially when you're gone off of the sherm

You could give a fuck about a nigga flossin

While you walkin, he on sixteen switches

Ain't that a bitch? But that's life

This shit ain't nothin' nice, and he'll take yours if his ain't right

And I can't stop 'em or knock 'em, but yo, I wouldn't even try, though

Cause Bible say, "Hey, either repent or you will die"

So (so, so), choose one (just one)

Either repent and get saved

Or put some food on your table for now





Street people

(People)

All my people be them niggas with an attitude

(We're ready for war)

The street mentality

It's do what you gotta do

(Do what you gotta do)





I see my sisters out there hustlin, man (strugglin, man)

Do what it takes, but that's the brakes, rustle up what you can

Gotta feed your babies (babies, yeah)

Handle yourself your own business

don't wait on that nigga to get you nothin

We been poor long enough, and I know you would scheme on somethin

(somethin, yeah) Take the welfare, fuck it!

The system givin it to you, cause it's guilt on they conscience

Don't let 'em fool you (don't let 'em fool you, no)

Really ain't doin' a nigga any favors

So come and get the paper, paper, before you die, die

This verse is for my ghetto queens

Tryin' to come up and get them better things

particularly cheddar cheese

Make that money (make that money)

Work, work, work

Whatever your occupation

As long as you bringin home the bacon, bacon, bacon

Don't let your enemy lock your mind, too

And I hope y'all really been payin attention cause it's 1999, ohh

(Ooh-ooh, yeah)

Though people comin around, we gon' thug

So where the thugs at?

Gimme some of that ghetto love (ghetto love) 









Now if y'all feelin me

let's get down and tear the roof off the mother

Shoot the mmotherfuckers, I'm serious and mean business

Ready to pump pump and ride, you with it?

Come on, put it out there, pump, pump, pump police

They treat us like animals - let's attack 'em like beasts

But hold on 'fore you start fightin (hold on, hold on)

Let's brighten up the action scene, pass me the gasoline

(no more, no more) I'm really not trippin on this rappin no more

Cause I know it won't last too much longer

When it's over, then I be a full-time soldier (I told you)

If I make it out of the game with all my sanity

Get paid, fuck the fame, get out quickly, understand me?

Cause at the rate I'm goin, pretty soon they'll try to ban me

for killin these muthafuckas tryin to tamper with my family

Now they got me runnin' from these po-po's tryin to jam me

But I told them muthafuckas not to try to test my manly

And this is my mentality for fuckin with the street life, street life

(street life)









I gotta give it up to all my thugstas, we're street people

Them niggas with an attitude

Let's stop the killin, we're strugglin just like you to make a livin

We're not pretendin, don't y'all remember?

It ain't easy tryin to stay alive, some people out there smokin crack

My people workin 9 to 5, just doin' it right

A nigga can vibe, 'cause y'all some cold ass playa playas

Hey, there Mo Thug and we gotsta give 'em some love

So now you're dealin' with the big pimps and the thugs

You get up too close and we fuckin' you up

Touched down and got with the realest niggas in the town

Now look who's in the Suave House

Yes it's truly-yours, Mister Sawed-Off Leatherface

A warrior ready for war, a natural soldier boy

Ready to move out, nigga

Ready to get with the shoot out

In the meanwhile I still gotta make me some money to get by

Yeah I thought to connect, and hooked up with MJG made money

Cause all that other shit don't mean a thing to me

But try to run up and I'm leavin' you stunned

Nobody will know who shot that punk

Cause I'm gonna dump it and run

Put him on the pave

And hey, that nigga that did it was wearin' a Leather Face

And not to be played with

Whatever you claim you better get paid

Shit





If you a pimp nigga, pimp them hoes

If you a thug, you better get ready for war

If you a hustla, make your dough

If you a gangsta, let your gun smoke





Who be I?

The nigga who pimpin'-a plenty of hoes

Look at the size of the bank that he hold

Natural born mind control

False niggas' gang blown away

It makes you wonder why niggas be hatin'

They jealous, they fellas be lookin' to take you under

It seems like the more that we get

You come with that shit

Lookin' for ways to drive us insane confusin' our brain

I'm settin' up traps for rats who snatch cheese

Fly like a trapeze artist

Tell 'em to bring it on I comes the hardest

MJG, pimp, runnin' with Bone dividin the throne

Regardless of niggas who stand in my path I'm bringin' it on

Recitin' the lyrical gift

The shit that give me the bitches, the money, the cars

How do you know when you're goin' too far

?

The further you get, the further you are

Shit, I breaks in half crook niggas

Don't make me laugh

Now, huh, which ones the head and, huh, which one's the ass

?

Where your bitch at

?

Collectin' my cash

Now who would've know that the bitch is a hood-rat

Increasin' my stash, leavin' you fast

You're thinkin' I'm slippin', I'm grippin' the Tech

Look at the bullets

They rippin' his vest open puttin' a hole in his chest

In piece is that nigga decide to rest

I'm leavin' you grievin', believin' in pimpin'

The shit that I got is the shit that I'm given

Constantly livin' that life of a thug

Drinkin' the Hen, smokin' the bud





If you a pimp nigga, pimp them hoes

If you a thug, you better get ready for war

If you a hustla, make your dough

If you a gangsta, let your gun smoke





Too many fake niggas done tried to contend

And then again, pinned that they couldn't win

Ken took it to the head with a fifth of Hen now I'm in the wind

500 Benzo, we roll, roll

Rod J came through with the Mack-10

Wish trippin' when I pulled out the glock

You know that all of my niggas be ready this pop-pop

Comin' with the heat cocked, 'cause it never did stop

Everybody I know out lookin' for a come up

We creep it's deeper than the way you perceive a thug,no love

Take a nigga through the mud everytime I try him from my wordly grudge

Buffet of lobsters, dressed in Esco' boxers

With honies that sex so proper, best flow since Rakim

Liver, personification of drama

Describe my, characteristics, murder co-signer

Some will smoke embalmin fluid and vomit to it

I'm straight chronic, yo it's atomic how I blew up

Nothin changed but my bankroll, still jig to the ankles







Please, to my niggaz

To my bitches, to my gangsters

To my riders, to my niggaz

To my riders, to my gangsters

To my bitches, to my niggaz

Yo, yo, we rippin tracks, it's like beatin beats with bats

Watchin crews change the views when the heat in they back

If you hear a click, trust me, you wouldn't hear clack

If you push it up front, I got no choice, but to pull it back

Your rhymes don't faze me, I'm above em; half y'all raps is

born retarded, now you out here tryin to get rid of em

You should be sick of it, I posess no flaws

That's from the man that made your Head Nod til you Lick-ed his Balls

Verses I spit em, when it's my turn to get em, I got hot flows

I only do shows for burn victims

So cock this mic, and bust out your back, kill you

And then they gonna blame me for fuckin up rap

Who's fuckin with that?  Skillz and Esco', it's on

When you speak in my direction, watch your tone

From Q-B to V-A, can't count the blocks we own

It's locked and sewn I repeat nigga, watch your tone









Yo commmmmme see

The big man with the diamonds and the fly Bentleys

Ladies loooooovve me; niggaz say

"Timbaland's really rappin, what the fuck is up B?"

Jeallllllousy

For Missy, Maganoo, and Timbaland

We gon' show you how to party right

So pass the UHH and get the hype

Alright, we gon' party tonight





If you're livin' for love, start livin' for life

If you're having a baby, then make her your wife

If you're up in the club where the dub

It's like a bank sell to the highest bid

Put the cash in your bank

Girl I'm lovin' your booty, you can "hoo" to my blow

Then fish but please honey child, don't kiss

All I want is a freak when I'm up in the club

Maybe after the dance, dinner sharp, then the tub

I'm a nigga wit' class, you're a girl with a job

Taste of my neck like corn on the cob

I'm second to none, I'm freaky as ever

Go downtown, "Well I never"





Uh, uh

Well I'm the man, that they call Timbaland

Now he the bir-ba-bir-ba-bird, understand?

We gon' party, until the sun comes up

Bartender, you forgot to fill up my cup, uh

Ain't no stoppin' until your draws start floppin'

There won't be no beef unless the disc stop jockin' (what?)

She said this, and he said that

And he said that Timbaland can't rap

But I don't care because I make dope tracks

I make you bounce and wiggle, and do this and that

Timbaland, where you live at?

VA baby, believe dat





Aiyyo, aiyyo

Now I'm rich, I once was poor

If you're late with my dough, then there's no show

I grease my hair and it still won't grow

If you feel my butt, boy you gotta go

Out the back for touchin' my back

For trying to jack every Timbaland track

Maganoo, where you was?

They been bitin' our style, those silly bugs

Where's the spray? I'ma spray 'em good

So the next time they bite they die like "Ugh"

I'ma roll up the biggest dutchie

Get some sweets cuz I got the munchies











He he

Girl, when the bar open up five rum

Everybody wanna get a buzz, get some

9 out of 10, all girls gonna freak

Just gon' depend on who they gonna freak

Don't gotta floss, all girls know they name

Only near, chillin' in the club, no game

Brotha mad at me cuz I got cheddar cheese

When the club close got his girl on her knees

Oh man please, learn the two degrees

Degree number one, keep your hon off trees

Degree number two, keep your girl 'round you

Never trust a girl, Lord knows what she do





Uh huh

Tricks - is what I got in my bag

Hits - is what I make out the lab

Ritz - is the crackers that I eat

Bitch - is what a man don't need

Rubber - shows I'm a careful lover

Stutter - is what I do in trouble, what?





My man, Timbaland

In the back rollin' trees

Gettin' high off the phone

Treated your physique like a beat and I rock that

You got your Hustle?  I ain't tryin to Knock that

Drop carats and the ring, make sure the rock's fat

You can rise, but you ain't tryin to stop that

You'd think I had the keys Boo the way I locked that

Oh that's your man?  I think it's time to drop that

Lay it off, play it off, yeah you get the props back

You get the dress, I get the cane and the top hat

After we done Boo, I let you run the clock back

Fallin in love?  Oh never not that

Who you know who control where they gettin jocked at?

And in Vegas I'm hittin it up like a slot rack

If you think you runnin game girl you need to botch that









Now when you came in the door, I seen you before

A dime, fine all the way to the core

Thick enough to make a nigga drop to the floor

Talked in your ear til my throat got sore

Lames, she could see my game was straight raw

Specially since she bought my tape right out the store

She was like, "Ain't you 'sposed to be out on tour?"

"Since you ain't tryin to go Boo, what you askin for?"

Need I say more, from the 8-oh-4

If you placin bets girl, then you best be sure

Slick, if you sick, then I got the cure

Chrome spinnin, we winnin Boo, check the score

Filthy rich, I like to dress like I'm four

Mami screamin, "Papi chu', who keeps stoppin you?"

 Freak or freeze, if the answer really is no

Girl I leave so fast you can speak to my breeze

She said, "You're stressin me now,"

Said, "No No No," then, "Yea yea yea" like she Destiny's Child

 We about to cook

Ceram' handle-arm, while y'all scramble on

Want to battle?  It's on, I'll take you on anywhere

You not a punk, you suppose to fear

Better not come out until the coast is clear





Totin' beer, you hatin', sayin' how they get a deal that fast

But even without this rap game I still have cash

My mommy wears a money wiz, I'm trickin' buying Vickey Secret

Just to cover her punani hair









Uh oh, you didn't think I was coming

My people can't stand for the little man

To rock without or with bad

I can determine what chu gon' do

Are ya gon' play it? Are ya gon' move?

The party ain't gon' start if ya don't dance

I don't care if you leave, but you still be my man

I don't get mad over silly pettyness

I say to hell with it, say oh well with it

Timbaland is known watch him make ya move ya feet

Make dope beats, rhyming sound so unique

His Beats are like Sean Archer and Caster Troy

Ya need the same identity to find how he soars

He's the wicked man, the wicked just begun

How da fuck you payin' a bitch just to fuck?

If a bitch want money for me, pray for luck

Only thing I love is weed and big cash

Leavin' freaky bitches in stitches, cuz hoe's be envious

Me and Timbaland still friends and will continuous

Oh, what a web we weave

State of mind, do or die, anytime

We can bang in the back of the 'Lac

Any damn thing bang

Do the thing in the back of the 'Lac

In the car, at the bar, gettin' high, wanna try

You went out with the heels on the block

Get the nine's all coughin'

And nigga's gon' run in our spot

Wonder why hypnotize, on my eyes and thighs

You ain't heard of me yet

But I betcha ain't met another one yet

Who do it like this

She even knows I'm hellerin

So they'll move till they pickin low, go over really 

If I say hit his head and then hang another round

That you hit it from the back and stroke

Left to the right keep it right on time

One time, two time for your mind

Better get soft layers and go over mine

Come about two chairs and go here's an ear if it's on tonight

Then this is the word I speak

Shit don't quicks mo' too tight





I come clear to your mouth and spit many a spouse and get

Civil cuz riddles can sizzle picks it a foul out

Package your rap attack, it's for presses and stash

They catch your track by the tail and smack they head on the nail

Factoring the jam made by Timbaland givin' fans something 

Bumpin' (bumpin') and scrumpin' for your consumption

Listen close to the slick and those quick quotes 

Keep gettin' dope shit, fuck with this, it'll get you so most





When she get crucial forget about what chu used to 

Cuz I'm here to pay dues too, nigga put it to the back sayin'

I'mma school you on the rules to how to tell who's who

On a cruise to who's tryin' to use you 

In the same sentence demention that will lose your attention

So pull mad intentions like Mag'

Lot of people gonna wanna see me stand stagnant, but it ain't gonna happen

Sound completely like Twista, or get mean like Mista'

For they feel the purple from the first time

The first rhyme that they first heard

First word, nigga's know that I'm a gold mine

Come on nigga's now lets go a time

Tell I'm in a power mood, the party groove records tour if I move it

I'mma support their dues or loose it

And if you love what you do, do what you feel

Then I know you gonna mark my words

Yall drop shit like birds

Then it's about the time for yo ass to get served

Just lay it on down

Just lay it on down 

While we relax to the tight raps

And the phat tracks

That that nigga Timbaland put down

Oh yes, let's get it on down to the nitty grit

Don't have no time for the patient

Cuz I got more dick than a lil' bit

And time flies, when I'm havin' fun

I can make a hoe get like Forrest Gump and just "run baby run"

I guess that they can't handle this

Brothers just to scandalous

If you don't wanna get freaked

then get out my way like an ambulance (say what)

Gitty up gitty up ride up on the real, let death to the fake

And tell you boyfriend just to chill, don't playa hate

Kick back relax, and just take off yo shoes

Cuz I gotta tell you what I wants to do (uh oh) 

Yea





Let me touch it (let me touch it)

Let me feel it (let me feel it)

Let me grab it (let me grab it)

So open up your eyes and get a surprise like in CrackerJacks

Punan' Don happy

Givin' up that nappy dug out

Get the cut up, then I cut out

Why you standin there wit yo' butt out (whoo)

And it's always in the back of my mind

Wherever the place, whenever the time

Even in College Park, after dark, I'ma get my sunshine

Closer than close, closer than most, then I'm all up in ya

Beginner, give me a thigh, breast, and wing like Ms. Winner

And let dinner be served

Can I get it on a platter, shatter your bladder

and put so much light in yo' life I'll make the roaches scatter

The wetta the betta, I'm ready to get ya

Gotta have rabbit like that cheddar

So I can freak ya like I just met ya

Kick back relax and just take off yo shoes

Yo' love is supa-cala-fragalistic

You don't know how bad I missed it

If it broke then don't fix it

Yo stuff is butta like a biscuit

Reminisce like Mary

I gotta pop that cherry

Kinda like that coochie

You wanna be my hoochie

Better than my advesary

Don't be so scary

I, never thought that you could act up

Make a nigga wanna back up

Keep it tight through the night while I wet this track up

So we can slip and slide

Make you wanna dip and dive

Trippin' while we rip and ride

Til I get to the coming side

Got you where I want yo ass

In the case of an emergency, break the glass

Keep yo eyes on the President, erase the past

We be happy if we had more blunts to pass

Get done up and run up

And the guts of yo butt don't shake like they used to

I wake 'em up like a rooster

Take it slow, not faster than a turbo rooster

No worry, no hurry

No pain, no gain

Keep yo eyes on strain

Cuz ain't a damn thing changed

Kick back, relax and take off yo shoes

Cuz I gotta tell you what I wants to do (uh oh) 

Yea







 

Let me touch it, let me touch it

Let me feel it, let me feel it

East Coast, feel me

>> cassidy

Okay.

This joint is knockin' right here

I don't even need to write to this joint this easy

I'mma just talk to 'em off the top, listen



My interpretation of what the game facin'

I'm basin' my facts on ancient civilization

And my proclamation plus the world and its foundation

My education is statin' black unification

Debatin' whether Satin is situatin'

And placin' me in a state of mind that can't be shaken

It's like a leech slurrin' my specch, energy taken

It's brakin' my fiberglass thoughts that pass through my mental

Lettin' off frustration through meditation in conventional

Dimension in teleportation

And like the length between words in the first grade my mind is spacin'

Out on route like telephone communications through nations

Give me 360 degree rotations my occupation

Spittin' flows and creatin' a creation through experimental situations

They drug me 'cuz my thoughts bloody like menstruations

Makin' my temperature heat up like incubation

They tracin' and chasin' from location to location

I'm stationed at a hotel accomidation

Waitin' to start me and my squad organization

But I'm hesitatin', too many outside irritations

Makin' me pause and might cause altercations

But I'm penetratin', surpassin' so-called limitations

Dedication, motivation and concentration

Manifestation is the key to escalation

And fluctuation of cheese might cause MC's suffocation

Or tax on cats 'cuz no jacks is bein' fakin'

They typically pissin' me off like urination

Deflation and toleration is in consideration

But me in my rankin' is like Bob Marley to Jamaicans

I might be...slightly exaggeratin' but eliminatin'

These snakes wit affiliation got the system scared

Like mice durin' extermination

Erasin' the rhymes rapper's lines wit time and patience

Takin' no shorts, thoughts like woo blunts I'm lacin'

Comin' down like condensation givin' proper information

My interpretation of the rap business

Since my christenin' I wanted to be a rap technician

Splittin' mics in half for my fans when I'm spittin'

Never forgettin' how rap started from the beginnin'

But most of these ignorant rappers talkin' 'bout money they gettin'

Bars they spittin', cars they whippin', nice clothes they dipped in

Hoes they hittin', 9's they grippin'

But they gotta expand they mind and rhyme somethin' different

For instance, that's what I be kickin' in my writtens

But if you listen pay attention positivity's mentioned

My composition has a 50 slash 50 division

I can please both crowds no vocals is my intentions

When I do that wit rap I expand my comprehension

Extendin' my knowledge like goin' to college at Princeton

The industry's missin' and interpretation that's sickenin'

They was wishin' I presented so now I'm forever in it

The business...

Y'all wanna fly like Mike... motherfuckas

So they won't find you, or your Jordans again

Take a boss to be ordered the men, give them a call

If you don't have my money, in 24 hours

Then the cocksucka won't see his daughter again

It's like the movie that you seen, I'm the star of the screen

I got a roll for you to play... stand here

And take six to the face, I dug a hole for you today

Holiday Styles, killin 20 soldiers in a day, what









Ayo I use to pitch nicks, now I spit rhymes

I'ma get mine, legit, or the quick grind

Shit my whole clique commit crimes

Did time, been on the strip and grip nines

But I swear to you motherfuckas

I got my gun right here, I ain't scared of you motherfuckas

I'm a hustler, plus a check cutter

I stretch butter, in ?? X, now that's gutter

I came for war, you know what them thangs is for

Slug make ya blood stain the floor

It ain't a game no more, niggaz gon' respect me

I grip gats, that kick back like Jet Li

So don't test me, or the boy S.P

Cause I ain't tryna get no fuckin blood, on my fresh tee

You don't impress me, STOP that cannon

Cause you could get ROCKED, when I POP that cannon








My blood pressure's buildin' 

It's Cassidy trick

It's Cassidy bitch

It's Cassidy clique

It's Cassidy beeyatch!





Ayo, what'chu know 'bout this world I'm in

Everynight I twist up and get drunk 'til I hurl again

Then i'll pour some more and start twirlin' then

And might go and get my pipes up by your girl and them

If you a thug, stop girlin' then

If I see a car in traffic, I'm a jacket like Burlington

It's Cassidy, who's thorough as him, nobody

I keep a gun tucked cause I don't trust nobody

I got plenty biscuits

And ya'll niggaz like skinny bitches yall ain't got nobodies

Watch how you talk to me man

Before you faggots get smacked with the dark skin part of my hand

Understand?









I'm the best in building, a prospect destined for millions

Threat to civillians and my blood pressure is building

Catch feelings? You be wet, catchin' a steel in

Weapons directed, at ya' chest, neck and ya' grill and

Still, there's no regrets, but I confessed that I kill men

I spill men's blood on the rug next to there children

And if you wan' set it? Cass' bettin' his deal in

Yes I will win, when I spill extra appealin'

Come to Limekill, we got them exstasy pills and

Got the whip fully equiped except for the ceilin'

I got a stash in it, the Smith-n-Wessun can chill in

I might get arressted, but until then?









If I hear you gettin' chips, pitbulls where you sleepin'

Everybody on the fuckin' floor, I'm squeezin'

Click the four, grip your whore by her weave and

Bitch, what muthafuckin' drawer is the keys in?

Got you on your knees like a braud and you pleadin'

(Uh, you got it dog, take it all, I don't need it)

I'll clap you and have you on your carpet, bleedin'

Throw your stuff in the trunk of the Ford then I'm leavin

Now I got a raw load more than I'm needin

And that's the reason, why you and whore is screamin'

Pull this, squeezed then if you holdin' them hammers

I'm focused like disposable cameras, nigga!

Then moved to the next (that ain't true) but it was something

about this girl's style that make me feel no regrets

We started off casual; walks through the park

Candle light dinners by dark, I'm thinkin smart (smart)

Afraid she might think I'm in a rush

To touch, crush and be up, but baby I ain't on that stuff

Dropped her off and told her call me up, we can talk

Conversate about political subjects whatever's sparks

So I zoomed off, lookin by and my phone rang

It was her in the shower, (she said) she said "I couldn't do without ya"

Then I said. . .

Game over I approched her wit a kiss on the cheek

The homeboys lookin at me sayin "Lil Howard you weak"

But you know how that go, what I got they want

What I got I flaunt, never mess wit it, please don't

Told her "I'm going home" she asked can she go too

(Whachu doin?) Nothing chillin at the Holidae In

(Who you wit?) Me and my peeps won't you bring four of your friends

(What we gon' do?) Feel on each other and sip on some Hen

One thing leading to another let the party begin





Peeps call me up  said it's a ho-tel party

Just bring the liquor it's already eight shawties

I'm on my way (way) let me stop by the store

Get a 12 pack of Corona, plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?

Now I'm on Highway 270 to Natural Bridge Road

I'm already blowed, get there I'm a be be blowed some mo'

Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning

Valet look like he in the game and must be winning

To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up

There's three girls on the elevator like "wassup"

I told em follow me they knew I had it cracking B

One said "ain't you that boy that be on BET?"

"Ya that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped wit much ding-a-ling"

Knock on the door I'm on the scene of things

Busted in, Henny bottle to the face!

Fuck it then, feel like my head a toxic waste

There's some pretty girls in herre, I heard em whispering

Talking bout "that's that dude that sing 'Right Thurr' he glistening"

I ain't come to talk (talk) I ain't come to sit (sit)

What I came for was to find out who I'm gon hit, aww shit









Ma showed up like "what's the hold up?"

Man know what get them wraps and roll up

I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin

You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping

Niggaz knocking on the door drunk and acting silly

The girl said "can I be in yo video" I'm like "yeah!", "oh really?"

Now she naked strip teasing, me I'm just cheesing

She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen

Handled that, told ol' G, bring tha camera

Then I thought about it, no footage as I ram her

Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still whiling

Sharing the next room wit some girls lookin like they from an island









Stop, drop, KABOOM!, baby rub on ya nipples

Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles

Far from little, make ya mammary glands jiggle

Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender biddles

Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles

Just play a little "D" and I'll make ya mouth dribble

Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle

I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not whiffle

Hit 'em in triples, wit no strikes, stripes, or whistles

I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle

Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels

For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle

Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, wit a ghetto tempo

I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple

Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again

My eyes chinky, I'm wit Chingy, at the Holidae In

It's time to take your ass on another kind of trip

grab your gat with the extra clip and,

close your eyes and hit the switch

We're going to a place where everybody kick it

kick it, kick it, yeah... that's the ticket

put something in the tank and I know that I can bring ya

If you can't take the heat get yo' ass out the kitchen

Come  along and ride on a fantasic voyage

slide slide slippity-slide

with switches on the block in a '65

Come  along and ride on a fantasic voyage

slide slide who-ride

ain't no valley low enough for mountain high



I'm tryin' to find a place where I can live my life and

maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice, a

place where my kids can play outside

without livin' in fear of a drive-by

and even if I get away from them drive-by killers

I still got to worry about those snitch-ass niggas

I keep on searchingcand I keep on looking

but niggas are the same from Watts to Brooklyn

I try to keep my faith in my people

but sometimes my people be acting like they evil

you don't understand  about runnin' with a gang

coz you don't gang bang, and

you don't have to stand on the corner and slang

coz you got your own thang

you can't help me if you can't help yourself

you better make a left



Come  along and ride on a fantasic voyage

slide slide slippity-slide

I do what I do just to survive

Come  along and ride on a fantasic voyage

slide slide who-ride

that's why I pack my .45



Life is a bitch and then you die

still tryin' to get a peace of the apple pie

every game ain't the same, coz the game still remains

don't it seem kinda strange, ain't a damn thing change

if you don't work then you don't eat

and only down-ass niggas can ride with me 

hop-hop-hop your five quickly down the block

stay sucka-free and keep the busters off your jock

you gotta have heart son, if you wanna go,

watch this sweet chariot swing low

ain't nobody cryin` ain't nobody dyin

ain't  nobody worryin', everybody's tryin

nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'

if you wanna have something, you better start frontin'

what ya gonna do when the 5 roll by

you better be ready, so you can ride



Come  along and ride on a fantasic voyage

slide slide slippity-slide

when you're living in a city it's do or die

Come  along and ride on a fantasic voyage

slide slide who-ride

you better be ready when the 5 roll by

just roll along- that's what you do

just roll along- that's right

just roll along- that's what you do

just roll along- that's right

do you want to ride with me, do you want to ride with me

do you want to ride with me, do you want to ride with me

do you want to ride with me, do you want to ride with me

do you want to ride with me, do you want to ride with me

Can I get my food stamps so I can leave

I got money and a car but they don't really know it

I'm living in a car drive back in the alley

but I use to shack up with a hooker named Sally

line after line

ruff is the time 

My life is in a bomb so I'm standing in the county line









I'm sittin' at a desk talking to a social worker

She thinks I'm a fool but I know that I can work her

Keep cryin and tell em I'll be home soon

Oh baby I'm goin crazy

Aw shit, there the lights go....





(Hello)





Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta (damn)

Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta (y'know)

Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta and I know he's a killer

but I love dat nigga





Hey ba-by

What's happenin honey?

How you doin?

I miss you





The kids keep askin where's their papa?

I had to tell em daddy got caught by the coppers

It's time for me to raise em up proper by myself

It's a goddamn struggle when a bitch ain't got no help

Now everybody tellin me that you ain't shit black

and when you get out, you'll jack and probably go right the fuck back

Damn, the pressure's gettin hot and heavy

and yeah, I'm gettin sweated by your homey in the blue and white Chevy

But now he's got a condo and a brand new Lexus

Wants me to take a trip with him down to Texas

The ends don't justify the means

and in another life he might've been the man of my dreams

But you know I got your back to the motherfuckin end

but a bitch can't even trip like she doen't have a friend









(Hello, you have a collect call from...)

Coolio!

(If you choose to accept this call please press 5 now)







What the fuck you mean you need a friend?

I can't be havin no niggas round my kids

Don't you make me break up outta this motherfucker

and start killin motherfuckers, SHIT!

I know it's rough, I know it's tough

but when you fumble in the game sometimes you get locked up

You better stay away punk ass bitch, he ain't shit

I don't wanna have to kill him

Cos think about the times that we used to have

Don't make me reach out and touch that ass

You put yourself in danger when you fuck with a buster

Like shootin dice without a pistol in a circle of murderers

You got more class than the average-type hooker bitch

Don't switch, he gotta grip but he ain't rich

Now I gotta check but if you've got the cheque

Give a nigga a look and put somethin on my books

Peace









Aiyo remember the homey with the Lexus, he took the trip to Texas

now he's wearin the fuckin Lexus like a necklace

So tell me, what's the drill, baby pa? What's a bitch to do?

My nigga's stretched in the pen since '92

Them visits ain't doin the trick, drop fucks make me sick

cos this po' puddy-tat needs a cat nip

And that motherfucker representin you, I think he resents you

He got evidence he never presents to

the people in court, I heard witnesses abortin

What's he doin about gettin you out to hold the fort?

I got some ends, I'ma send you a dime and two doves

Mama hates you but damn I got love for a gangsta






(I got my) I got my hand on my nutsac burnin 'cross the stage

in a motherfuckin rage like a animal in a cage

I catch wrecks like a junkyard fool (fool)

Fuck around and get'cha holdin that jar, Cool!

Yep that's me on the motherfuckin mic-a (mic-a)

Nova, happy to strike niggas like a viper

Who rules the step to the rep that I kept

for a long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

I got mor flavour then a truck load of Snickers

Ya punch her by the straps, ya got ta kick her, fuck it!

That's how it go when ya dealin with a pro-per

Got my hand on the mic and I'm about to let it flow

Coolio locc and I'm down ta blast

Peter Piper picked a paper, pick a pepper's and I jacked his ass

Motherfuckers curse me but they can't hurt me

When I'm doin dirt, that's why I show no mercy

I flips tha scripts and it's tha dips when I rips

and rock tha fuckin house for the Bloods and Crips

Danger danger, ol' gangsta gangsta

droppin dogs on the ??

40 Thevz and the band witta plan to make some stops

Niggas die on the street but they don't play taps

It was a black and white thang but now it's blue and red

This ain't an episode of Batman, it's more'n like a Blackman

Slap yo' ass up and I jacked ya for ya Walkman

Niggas on the top and you don't deserve nothin

They fightin punks, their rags is fucked, they shouldn't even be bumpin

Suckas play the back cos I'm dope when I rap

And my hand's on my motherfuckin nutsac

and it's like that!



It's time for me to step so I'm steppin in deep (deep)

I was born a thief so ya know I'm on the creep

Sucka nigga wanna test me but he can't best me

Buck-buck to the chest and I guess you're death-ly

Now I gotta treat ya like a sucka

C-C-Coolio but you can call me Boo

I drop da shit on ya lyrics cos ya rhyme style is doo-doo

with a flashlight cos I serve dat ass (right, right, right)

Word to the motherfuckin homies and you know you can't hold me

or throw me...so blow me

How many niggas must I stick

before you get my d'ift and fully understand not to fuck with this

I never been a stoner, take ya momma home and blown her

One night stand and once again she's a loner

Cos I won't be played out, strung out, laid out

She only gave it up because she thought I had some crack

and I won't be strayed by a lame ass dame

Keep my dollars in my pockets cos I'm hip to ya game

Hoes be acting like they love me but they only wanna fuck me

and suck me but don't touch me

Back up off me hooker cos I won't be taken

Go find you another motherfucker you can break it

I gots ta keep playin these niggas like ping-pong

'93 is the year and yes I'm gettin bigger

Gave a shot to the 121 cos they my niggas

Only God knows if he'll catch a hot one

Knick-knack paddy-wack Wino's in the back

and my hand's on my motherfuckin nutsac

And it's like that





I got my hand on my nutsac

Na na na na na naaaaaa



And it's like that


Once upon a time in a land called fuck

Lived a duck named Donald and his mother was a cluck

Mickey Mouse wore a rag, pants in a sag

Neighborhood kingpin, but his brother was a fag

Donald had beef, so Mickey couldn't sleep

They was hootin for a while, and it was gettin kinda deep

Bugs Bunny had the props on the Eastside spots

Known to hit a five from a mile with a shot

Goofy was Mickey Mouse righthand man

One day smoked a stick, and came up with a brand

Called Pixie and Dixie, two killers from Chicago

A game of 5K, to eliminate Donald

But what they didn't know, is Donald was a G

Had big time respect, from the West to the East

Haps up see, and listen to the funk

First chapter in the funky cartoon from the ghetto



Huey and Duey and Louie with a

Shot down Mickey Mouse main ho Minnie

Everybody know Minnie got shot down

And the cop on the case was Huckleberry Hound

Huckleberry had a Deputy, by the name of Dog

Eye-witness to the crime was Kermit the Frog

But Kermit was scared and he wouldn't testify

Pixie and Dixie just did a driveby

On Donald Duck, but they shot and they missed

And now Bugs Bunny is gettin kind of pissed

Cause the shot that they missed hit his homeboy Elmer

Bugs sellin drugs on the motherfuckin corner

The future's lookin shitty in fuck city

So they called in the Feds, Beetlejuice and Miss Piggy

Shit's on the street, no that's how it goes

Scene two in the funky cartoon from the ghetto



Now the war is on and Mickey Mouse is dead

Quick Draw McGraw took two to the head

Huey and Duey and Louie got caught

And now they in the county, ready to sell out

Pixie and Dixie's on the run from the mob

Cause they tried to kill Donald and they didn't do the job

Bugs Bunny got popped, in a bar gettin drunk

Bullet fucked up Beetlejuice, while Miss Piggy had a pump

Donald got the word that his nephews was snitchin

So Tom and Jerry stuck em on they way to the kitchen

Goofy was a punk and everybody knew

Him and Huckleberry Hound was spotted drinkin brew

In the alley out back, in the corner in the dark

But they both got smoked by Jabberjaw the Shark

Donald Duck got the whole damn city sewed up

In a ghetto cartoon in a land called fuck




Alright alright, alright alright alright.

Next we got a guy comin out from

Compton, California, gonna tell you all about his experiment with a drug called Stix.

That's some kind of embalment fluid mixed with scherm those niggas down in...ha, those black guys down in Compton.



Yo stop that!





Who got the bomb? Who got the bomb?

Somebody? Anybody? Who got the bomb?





Pass me the dip, it's time to take a hit

of the potent ass shit the kind that make you strip

Two headed critter, now I'm an airplane

flyin high inside my brain

You know karate, I no rizzeign

Try to beat me down I feel no pain

Puffer, toker, loopy loop smoker

Coolio loca, laugh like The Joker

Loony, psychotic, nutty, kinda crazy

Down for mine that's the way mama raised me

Summertime we freak in the heat

Butt naked in the middle of the street

We're smokin stix

Yeah









If you don't know how to do it, yo here's how ya do it

Take the scherm and cigarette and dip it in the fluid

Oh my God! Oh my God! Now the shit is lookin lovely

Light and stars all around me and above me

Never feelin good, I watch a motherfucker work

Try to step into the Circle I chop em up like wood

put em in an envelope and send it off to Interscope

Cos nigga's gettin short, I'm chokin from the smoke

I pass it to my homey so he can take a toke

Got a large loot, got it robbin that's cos I was broke

Jumped in the bucket, mad styles like a demon

If only you could trip off that shit that I'm seein

I got to get a grip cos the nigga's about to flip

Sometimes that's how it get when you're smokin stix

Yeah









Wake up the next morning in a cold sweat

under the bed, soakin wet, wearin boots and a hair net

Empty .45 was layin on the dresser

Last night I played the role of the tester

Toked up a good bag, Jenna had a good nap

Flashback got me ready to scrap

I don't know what I done did

and I don't know where I done been

I know last night I robbed my friend

and if that's wrong then call it a sin

But I was broke and broke ain't no joke

and I can't cope without my Smith so

so dip it up and watch me suck it up

and I'll get fucked up and I might go nuts

So pass the loot motherfucker, pass the loot!

Pass the loot motherfucker to a troop

We're smokin stix


Back in the days when I was a young buck

Stuck like a truck gettin shit outta luck

Times was rough and I didn't have a plan

I was barely on the edge of my life as a man

It's really fucked up when there's dope in the crib

No food in the kitchen for the motherfuckin kids

That's why a young nigga learned how to steal,see

Shopliftin laid me a whole lotta meals

But I remember days when the cupboard was bare and

Life was unfair but who the fuck cares?

I still hear Momma,what she used to tell me

That you don't get shit in this life for free

And even if I never ever make it to the mountain top

Fuck it!I fight for my hip-hop

Not everybody can relate to what I been through

Even though some front and they try to pretend to

Know about the life of a kid and the strife

Where he has to live in the shadow of a base-pipe

Good goes to bad,bad goes to worse

And pretty soon he's stealin from his own Momma's purse

So clean out ya ears and open up your eyes

I reach out to touch but somebody moved the sky

My stomach is growlin,word is born

Cos all I had for dinner was a can-o-corn



A can-o-corn,a can-o-corn

All I had for dinner was a can-o-corn

A can-o-corn,a can-o-corn

Before I went to school I had a can-o-corn

A can-o-corn,a can-o-corn

I tried to get full off a can-o-corn

A can-o-corn,a can-o-corn

That's all the fuck that we had in the kitchen



A few years later,I pledge a legions to the set

I'm growin up but I ain't grown yet

It's funny how the strain in a life filled with pain

Can sometimes leave a bitch stained on the brain

I'm sittin in the restaurant,guardin my food like a eagle

Pickin up scraps like a seagull

Waitin on the people at the next table to leave a tip

So I can put it in my pocket

Phoney Easter Bunny,Santa Claus and the stork

We was poor as fuck so we ate a lot of pork

And it ain't no motherfuckin way no how

When it come up I let you bring me down

So I stick to the boots and I'm down with a MAAD group

Of gangstas and hoodlums,but you can call em 'scroops'

Give me liberty or give me death

Cos a man without pride ain't got shit left,huh

And now that I'm older with kids of my own 

I put me in the pot where it used to be a bone

Get'cha self together,word is born

Cos a man can't live on a can-o-corn

and like Mike Tyson, baby, my style is (causing static)

and jabbin' stabbin' mutha fucka you don't want static

nineteen ninety fo' and you cowards all done had it

but that's alright because I gotta kill a crew

(I'm down with the MAAD ass you know who)









another day, another dollar, I'll be there when ya holla

it's the skanded ass, sticky face, alleway scholar

I dip two sticks off a ten dollar, fold it

turn it to the hook and kick in the door

I, always feel like somebody's watchin' me

and, even though you're watchin, you can't stop a G

cause I been where you're goin' and I know what you see

you might build a rep, but not on the C, double O to the L to the I to the O

One dark night I need some ins

I got a spot cased out I'm breakin in

I gotta cutter that'll cut thru ya window like butter

Suction cup, window up

Now I'm on the inside lookin for some loot

38 special I don't wanna have to shoot

I ain't no young, raw fresh recruit, uhh

Steel tote boots, black khaki suit

A real quick search and nobody's home

just like I planned, now I'm home alone

I hope ya don't mind if I use tha phone

and fix me sometin to eat before I'm gone

I got the servant and the china, deuce-five and the 9

Rolex off the desk so I can tell the time

No one knows where the flow goes when the 'dults crow

you better take some no doughs

Now I'm out tha back with a sack fulla goods

throw it in the truck, take it back to the hood

Let me be brief, I'm on the creep

I stole the sounds out'cha jeep, it takes a thief





Oh yeah! It takes a thief

Yeah yeah! It takes a thief

It takes a motherfuckin thief! It takes a thief

Keep both eyes open when you go to sleep

Oh yeah! It takes a thief

Yeah, yeah! It takes a thief

It takes a motherfuckin thief! It takes a thief

Keep ya hand on your gun when I'm on the creep



I need a lick real quick-like

My mind ain't wrapped tight

I scale like Mike Tys so call this fright night

You don't wanna see me comin down the street when I'm broke and it's dark

So run your motherfuckin pockets 'fore they find your ass dead in the park

Put your hands behind your head and interlock your fingers

No I ain't the cops, I just want your rings

and your wallet and your watch and your fat gold chain

Don't try nuttin strange or I'm blowin out'cha brains

I rob from the rich so I can get rich

I ain't got shit so I take what I can get

I need my mail, my snaps, my dollars, my ends

my grip ain't high enough so I'm robbin on my friends

Somebody out there's out to get me

The smaller the nigga, the bigger the gat be

I don't give a fuck about your pain and your grief

You shouldn't of fell asleep, it takes a thief







There's a buster on the West Side, I heard he gotta grip

and he's outta town on business so I'm schemin on his shit

I heard he got kis and Gs and deeds

and guns and big trash bags full o' weed

I stole a brand new fresh shaft telephone van

so now I guess I'm the telephone man

The bathroom window ain't got no alarm

I gotta skelton brick that works like a charm

It didn't take long to find what I was lookin for

I was damned near finished when I heard a key in the door

I jumped in the closet and checked my clip

Pulled my ski mask down, I can't believe this shit

I counted to five and the front door opened up

I counted three more and the front door was shut

I counted five more to give me some space

then I jumped out the closet and bucked him in the face

I loaded up the van in broad daylight

cos Looky Lou's have their high beams on at night

I take the backstreets to avoid the heat

and never let em see me sweat, it takes a thief









Oh yeah!

Yeah yeah!

Hey yeah!

Just a reminder to let you know

there's motherfuckers out there that want your shit

So you better watch out, better watch your back

Can't be goin to sleep, protect your shit

Know what I'm sayin?

house niggas who forget their colour.Put on a suit and tie and escape from

the ghetto and don't never come back.Yeah motherfucker,you can run but you

sure can't hide!



Deep down in the jungle with a crack to the throat

Niggas kill niggas for steppin on their toe

A girl is a bitch and a lady is a ho

When anything goes for a little bit o'docey

Shit get cooked by thugs and crooks

With the knowledge of a scholar but they don't read books

Everyday is a chance that ya life might go

So today is a day that ya gotta get paid

Slang them ki's,make them g's

Do what'cha want but ya sell what'cha please

But don't fuck ?? where you come from

Cos when you do that you're done 

Remember your niggas and bitches and your Trojans

And take it to your pockets for some fitness

When ya get it goin and ya got it goin good

Ya better bring back somethin for da hood

LA County what's goin on?

1993 modern day Babylon

Peace to the niggas from the street

And rest in peace to the others that's six feet deep

Welcome to the fool and he strikes when he's back

And the snake come around,go around and get ape

Top down,slipped on CO-run they none

Every (?cisscrack?)-CAINE ain't no fun

Black cop white cop 

Fuck the colour of skin make sure he shot 

Escape from a jail cell,split away from hell

And all I want for Christmas is a Glock and some shells

(What'cha gonna do when you get out of jail?)

Martin Luther King didn't wear a diamond ring

But he had a dream to let freedom reign

My homie Red Foxx got played like blocks

Pick em up sticks,jacks and hop-scotch

??,aggravation,there's no end to the situation

Cos niggas need a place to meet,a place to sleep

A place to eat and rest they feet

But nobody really even gives a fuck

That's why so many niggas is maggot'd up,huh

It hasn't been an easy road for me.



But one day, myspace made history

Hooked up with big homie on the west

JR

Introducing Sean Kingston

You think you really know?

 but you have no idea.


Kingston, Kingston, Kingston


I see them coming from afar
I got my eyes open I'm ready for war
When I fight mon' they know who we are
A Kingston they come from, A Kingston they come through
I see them coming from afar
The vision thinks that I'm gonna get a scar
When I fight mon' they know who we are
A Kingston they come from, A Kingston they come through

My mom is my hero
Two three nine zero
The doctor was lookin' at a star.
From then I've been strictly on a mission
I got twenty-twenty vision
All the haters I can spot them from far
I'm sure
Jamacains on slash date
Probably representin' and bringing it home
After I sing my songs
I duck trouble but it keep on lurkin'
Things going to well the devil start workin

I see them coming from afar
I got my eyes open tough luck for ya'll
Crush, Crush the wall
I'm still a young boy that drive all the grown folks right up the wall

I'm aware of the snakes cause they near
They plottin' to get me
I'm watching my peers
Bout time in a million
It's close man i swear
I feel it in the air and i'm order for them


I see them coming from afar
I got my eyes open I'm ready for war
When I fight mon' they know who we are
A Kingston they come from, A Kingston they come through
I see them coming from afar
The vision thinks that I'm gonna get a scar
When I fight mon' they know who we are
A Kingston they come from, A Kingston they come through

I'm what it is i'm Macdola hype with a game to back
Spitting a big ticket number one in the track
Ease along, baby say ease the bar
My b's the door
Bout to take the game by storm

The one and only
Haters got nothing on me
I can feel the vibe
I see it in their eyes
They praying for my demise
They don't want to see me blow yo
Rather see me low low
Or I be on the floor yo
But no yo
I'm pull through this game of tug o' war
What you fellas fussing for
Maybe cause i'm grubbing more
None the less, i'm paying my dues
Don't hate me
A little hard work will get you here too

I got next, better yet i got now
Everybody got faith and yelling cause my hot style
86 the bullshit they don't want me hostile
I'ma reign supreme until the day i drop down


I see them coming from afar
I got my eyes open I'm ready for war
When I fight mon' they know who we are
A Kingston they come from, A Kingston they come through
I see them coming from afar
The vision thinks that I'm gonna get a scar
When I fight mon' they know who we are
A Kingston they come from, A Kingston they come through

...................

And I never thought

That we was gonna see each other (see each other)

And then I came out

Oh I'm with my girl

Who I thought was my world

It came out to be

That she wasn't the girl for me (girl for me)









Now we're fussin'

And I don't know

How to make it better (make it better)

Mommy just dry your eyes, mommy don't you cry

I know we've been through hard times and the struggles

And I just wanna tell you I love you





Only 15 put under pressure

First month 27th day,

They took away my mother

I was left to be raised by my brother

Taught to be a hustler

Mommy gone gotta stick together

Stay strong through the stormy weather

Became a top seller, look how we stacking this cheddar

When you jump mommy life would be better

Just like Rihanna you can stand under my umbrella





You know how to make me better

Even when we lose our cheddar

Even through the stormy weather

You hold me down





Mommy just dry your eyes, mommy don't you cry

I know we've been through hard times and the struggles

And I just wanna tell you I love you







17 got a little money

Feeling kinda blue

Cause it's looking like you doing 10 to 20

Riding being broke ain't funny

It's all being hungry

But I'm gonna keep hustling for my mommy

Until I get rich like puffy

Never had a plan 'B'

You said I can be all I can be

Some day I'm gonna buy you Miami

So when I win my Grammy

You coming cause I do this for my family













17 now my mommy's gone

Cant wait till she come back home

Missing her face like dust till dawn,while she went away

Never think it be so long

I feel like crying while I'm writing this song

Cant wait till that day come on

When she leave the place





Hey whats up mom,how you doing?

Its been about 2 years since I saw your face

I miss you like crazy

Know the money orders the pre-paid costs

Being on my own

No Knee Kurt Canino

But I love you though

This for you

Se dice que el ansioso

esconde un alma en paz,

viajero o misionero

va lejos mucho mas

Si miro hasta el cielo

o dentro mio, no se,

ya nada importa mucho

si peudo con sinceridad

saber que, lo intente.



Como el mar y su creciente

va la gente al andar

como el viento y su corrida

va la vida al andar

como el sol a la manana

que reclama el andar

atesoro el momento

vivo y siento

es mi intento

y lo hago al andar.



Viaje por tantos lados

en la imaginacion

estamos siempre andando

sin tiempo ni razon

quien sabe las respuestas

quien puede elegir

si existen diferencias

sabemos que hay, en cada ser

deseos de vivir.



Como el mar y su creciente

va la gente al andar

como el viento y su corrida

va la vida al andar

como el sol a la manana

que reclama el andar

atesoro el momento

vivo y siento

es mi intento

y lo hago al andar.



La brisa que acaricia

con suavidad el mar

y todas las gaviotas

que vuelan sin cesar

lo veo y lo siento

y no lo se explicar

esplendido momento

sentir llover

y el sol nacer

vivir y disfrutar



Como el mar y su creciente

va la gente al andar

como el viento y su corrida

va la vida al andar

como el sol a la manana

que reclama el andar

atesoro el momento

vivo y siento

es mi intento

y lo hago al andar.



Como el viento y su corrida

va la vida al andar

como el sol a la manana

que reclama el andar

atesoro el momento

vivo y siento

es mi intento

y lo hago al andar.






Take it easy with me, please

Touch me gently like a summer evening breeze

Take your time, make it slow

Andante, Andante

Just let the feeling grow



Make your fingers soft and light

Let your body be the velvet of the night

Touch my soul, you know how

Andante, Andante

Go slowly with me now



I'm your music

(I am your music and I am your song)

I'm your song

(I am your music and I am your song)

Play me time and time again and make me strong

(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong)

Make me sing, make me sound

(You make me sing and you make me...)

Andante, Andante

Tread lightly on my ground

Andante, Andante

Oh please don't let me down



There's a shimmer in your eyes

Like the feeling of a thousand butterflies

Please don't talk, go on, play

Andante, Andante

And let me float away



I'm your music

(I am your music and I am your song)

I'm your song

(I am your music and I am your song)

Play me time and time again and make me strong

(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong)

Make me sing, make me sound

(You make me sing and you make me...)

Andante, Andante

Tread lightly on my ground

Andante, Andante

Oh please don't let me down



Make me sing, make me sound

(You make me sing and you make me...)

Andante, Andante

Tread lightly on my ground

Andante, Andante

Oh please don't let me down

Andante, Andante

Oh please don't let me down...


Ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah

Ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah

Ah-ha-ha, keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes

I keep thinking, a-aaah



Last night I was taking a walk along the river

And I saw him together with a young girl

And the look that he gave her made me shiver

'Cause he always used to look at me that way

And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say

Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play



Look into his angeleyes

One look and you're hypnotized

He'll take your heart and you must pay the price

Look into his angeleyes

You'll think you're in paradise

And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise

Don't look too deep into those angeleyes

Oh no no no no



Ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah

Ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah

Ah-ha-ha, keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes

I keep thinking, a-aaah



Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him

And it hurts to remember all the good times

When I thought I could never live without him

And I wonder does it have to be the same

Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?

Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?



Look into his angeleyes

One look and you're hypnotized

He'll take your heart and you must pay the price

Look into his angeleyes

You'll think you're in paradise

And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise

Don't look too deep into his angeleyes

Crazy 'bout his angeleyes

Angeleyes

Once he took my heart and now I pay the price

Look into his angeleyes

You'll think you're in paradise

And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise

Don't look too deep into those angeleyes

Oh no no no no



Ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah

Ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah



Ah-ha-ha, keep thinking, ah-aaaah

Keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes

Ah-ha-ha, keep thinking, ah-aaaah

Keep thinking, I had to pay the price






Day is dawning and I must go

You're asleep but still I'm sure you'll know

Why it had to end this way

You and I had a groovy time

But I told you somewhere down the line

You would have to find me gone

I just have to move along

Just another town, another train

Waiting in the morning rain

Lord give my restless soul a little patience

Just another town, another train

Nothing lost and nothing gained

Guess I will spend my life in railway stations

Guess I will spend my life in railway stations



When you wake I know you'll cry

And the words I wrote to say goodbye

They won't comfort you at all

But in time you will understand

That the dreams we dreamed were made of sand

For a no-good bum like me

To live is to be free



Just another town, another train

Waiting in the morning rain

Look in my restless soul, a little patience

Just another town, another train

Nothing lost and nothing gained

Guess I will spend my life in railway stations

Guess I will spend my life in railway stations






I'll never know why I had to go

Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show

Boy, I was tough, packing all my stuff

Saying I don't need you anymore, I've had enough

And now, look at me standing here again 'cause I found out that

Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here

Gotta have you near



As good as new, my love for you

And keeping it that way is my intention

As good as new and growing too

Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension

It's as good as new, my love for you

Just like it used to be and even better

As good as new, thank God it's true

Darling, we were always meant to stay together



Feel like a creep, never felt so cheap

Never had a notion that my love could be so deep

How could I make such a dumb mistake

Now I know I'm not entitled to another break

But please, baby, I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that

Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here

Gotta get you near



I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again



As good as new, my love for you

And keeping it that way is my intention

As good as new and growing too

Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension

It's as good as new, my love for you

Just like it used to be and even better

As good as new, thank God it's true

Darling, we were always meant to stay together



Yes the love I have for you feels as good as new

Darling, we were always meant to stay together


Baby

You can do magic

Baby 

Isn't it tragic

Maybe

You can do something I can't

And I can't get enough of it



Baby 

You can do wonders

Maybe

You can do something I can't

So don't stop doing it

Don't stop doing it



Baby 

You can do wonders...


Making somebody happy is a question of give and take

You can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break

Every smile and every little touch

Don't you know that they mean so much

Sweet sweet kisses so tender

Always will return to sender



Like a bang, a boom-a-boomerang

Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum

Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang

Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum

So give it away, I think you'll learn

You'll get love in return

So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love

A boom-a-boomerang is love



Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere

When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care

Never use it as a selfish tool

Never ever be such a fool

Every feeling you're showing

Is a boomerang you're throwing



Yes a bang, a boom-a-boomerang

Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum

Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang

Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum

So give it away, I think you'll learn

You'll get love in return

So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love



And if you're warm and tender

I'll kiss you, return to sender

Please surrender



Bang, a boom-a-boomerang

Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum

Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love

A boom-a-boomerang is love


Down in the street they're all singing and shouting

Staying alive though the city is dead

Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter

While you are crying alone in your bed



Pity Cassandra that no one believed you

But then again you were lost from the start

Now we must suffer and sell our secrets

Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts



Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood

Now the last day is dawning

Some of us wanted but none of us could

Listen to words of warning

But on the darkest of nights

Nobody knew how to fight

And we were caught in our sleep

Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe

You really had the power

I only saw it as dreams you would weave

Until the final hour



So in the morning your ship will be sailing

Now that your father and sister are gone

There is no reason for you to linger

You're grieving deeply but still moving on

You know the future is casting a shadow

No one else sees it but you know your fate

Packing your bags, being slow and thorough

Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait



Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood

Now the last day is dawning

Some of us wanted but none of us could

Listen to words of warning

But on the darkest of nights

Nobody knew how to fight

And we were caught in our sleep

Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe

You really had the power

I only saw it as dreams you would weave

Until the final hour



I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise

Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain

She stood on deck, just a tiny figure

Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain

Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood

Now the last day is dawning

Some of us wanted but none of us could

Listen to words of warning

But on the darkest of nights

Nobody knew how to fight

And we were caught in our sleep

Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe

You really had the power

I only saw it as dreams you would weave

Until the final hour



I'm sorry Cassandra

I'm sorry Cassandra


Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you've broken a feather
I hope we can patch it up together

Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

So the walls came tumbling down
And your love's a blown out candle
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it
I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita


Chiquitita, dime por que

tu dolor hoy te encadena

en tus ojos hay

una sombra de gran pena.



No quisiera verte asi

aunque quieras disimularlo

si es que tan triste estas

para que quieres callario



Chiquitita, dimelo tu

en mi hombro, aqui llorando

cuenta conmigo ya

para asi seguir andando



Tan segura te conoci

y ahora tu ala quebrada

dejamela arreglar

yo la quiero ver curada



Chiquitita, sabes muy bien

que las penas vienen y van y desaparecen

otra vez vas a bailar y seras feliz,

como flores que florecen.



Chiquitita, no hay que llorar

las estrellas brillan por ti alla en lo alto,

quiero verte sonreir para compartir

tu alegria, Chiquitita.



Otra vez quiero compartir

tu alegria Chiquitita.

>> aha

Talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today isn't my day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, OK?

Take on me (take on me),
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
Of odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is OK.
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry

Take on me (take on me),
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Oh, things that you say
Is it a life or just to play my worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me (take on me),
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day

Take on me (take on me),
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day


He likes to have the morning paper's

Crossword solved

Words go up words come down

Forwards backwards twisted round

He grabs a pile of letters from a small 

suitcase

Disappears into an office

It's another working day



And his thoughts are full of 

strangers

Corridors of naked lights

And his mind once full of reason

Now there's more than meets the 

eye

Oh, a stranger's face he carries with 

him



He likes a bit of reading on the subway 

home

A distant radio whistling tunes that 

nobody knows

At home a house awaits him, He 

unlocks the door

Thinking once there was a sea here

But there never was a door



And his thoughts are full of 

strangers

And his eyes to numb to see

And nothing that he knows of

And nowhere where he's been

Was ever quite like this

And his thoughts...



And at heart

He's full of strangers

Dodging on his train of thought

Train of thought


Here I am

And within the reach of my hands

She sounds asleep and she's sweeter now

Than the wildest dream could have seen her

And I Watch her slipping away

Though I know I'll be hunting high and low



High

There's no end to the lengths I'll go to

Hunting high and low

High

There's no end to lengths I'll go



To find her again

Upon this my dreams are depending

Through the dark

I sense the pounding of her heart

Next to mine

She's the sweetest love I could find

So I guess I'll be hunting high and low



High

There's no end to the lengths I'll go to

High and Low

High

Do you know what it means to love you...



I'm hunting high and low

And now she's telling me she's got to 

go away

I'll always be hunting high and low

Hungry for you

Watch me tearing myself to pieces

Hunting high and low



High

There's no end to the lengths I'll go to

Oh, for you I'll be hunting high and 

low


I find it hard to breathe

As life just eats away

At the faces that surround me

They look tired today

The lady at my table

Doesn't want me here

I just want to talk to her



But would she laugh at my accent

And make fun of me

Oh, it doesn't seem like this

Blue sky's here for me



There are no girls in here

As far as I can see

Only pin-up posters

Looking down at me

Watching papercups of coffee

Growing cold before my eyes

All the things I see

That make me realize



I'm in this big world without you

Nothing to my name

Oh, I never knew that

Blue sky meant such pain



I'm dying to be different

In the coffee shop

I've lived on borrowed strength

Now my supplies are cut

Though i'm older than my looks

And older than my years

I'm too young to take on

My deepest fears



Oh, I used to be confused

But now I just don't know

Since you left I've been watching

Blue skies come and go

Since you left I've been watching

Blue skies come and go


I've fixed my dwelling for the night
Lights in pairs come passing by
where I hide
I need some time now on my own
Leave my loneliness alone
To lick my wounds
Night has found me just in time
to help me close my eyes
one more time

Living a boy's adventure tale
In so many ways
Living a boy's adventure tale
For so many days
I'm living a boy's adventure tale
Can't escape, if I wanted to
Living a boy's adventure tale
I may be dreaming but I feel awake

I've been lost in so many places
Seen the love in so many faces
A change of weather,
the rain pours down
My head in hands,
pressed to the ground
And where am I supposed to go now

Living a boy's adventure tale
In so many ways
Living a boy's adventure tale (aah)
Living a boy's adventure tale
a voice I hear
Living a boy's adventure tale
Singing a lullaby for me
Living a boy's adventure tale
Because of you
Living a boy's adventure
Oh you know it's true
Living a boy's adventure tale
In so many ways (aah)
For so many days
I love you. I love you
So many ways


Touch me

How can it be

Believe me

The sun always shines on T.V

Hold me

Close to your heart

Touch me

And give all your love to me

To me...



I Reached inside myself

And found nothing there

To ease the pressure of

My ever worrying mind

All my powers waste away

I fear the crazed and lonely looks

The mirror's sending me

These Days

Please don't ask me to defend

The shamefull lowlands

Of the way I'm drifting

Gloomily through time



I reached inside myself today

Thinking there's got to be some way

To keep my troubles distant



Touch me

How can it be

Believe me

The sun always shines on TV

Hold me

Close to your heart

Touch me

And give all your love to me


Please don't hurt me
I have told you
All my love is all I've got
And tomorrow is the day
When I for your sake
I'm coming back

And you tell me
That I don't love you

I'm trying hard to make you jealous
Trying harder to make you stay
Days are longer
Nights are crazy
It's so strange when you're away

And you tell me
That I don't love you
Because I love you I will show you
All the faces my love can have
So please
Let me come to you
And stay this time

And you tell me
That I don't love you
Oh you know
That it's just not true


My breath was coming fast

And as i make a start

You turn to go

oh, oh

I'll do what you want me to

I'll cry at the thought of the loss of a 

heart



Love is reason

Love is reason

Love is reason

Love is reason enough



My morals are changing fast

I told you it wouldn't last

You turn and go

oh, oh

I'll be what you want me to be

I'd die at the thought of the loss of 

your heart



Love is reason

Love is reason

Love is reason

Love is reason enough


Dream myself alive

I dream myself alive

You can't deny

There's something dark

Against the light

All i can say

It doesn't have to be this way

We'll be chasing our tails madly

See days pass like wildfire

Right from the start

I knew this world would break my 

heart



I dream myself alive

Dream myself alive

I dream myself alive

Break my heart

And dream myself alive

What can it mean



I'm drawing pictures of the sea

Right from the start

I knew this girl would break my heart



Dream myself alive

Dream myself alive

I dream myself alive

Dream myself alive

Dream myself alive

I dream myself alive


Help me

I need your love

Don't walk away

The dark scares me so

We're nothing apart

Let's stay friends forever

Forever



Here I stand and face the rain

I know that nothing's gonna be the same again

I fear for what tomorrow brings



Trust me

For who I am

Place all your faith

Into these hands

I got nothing to say

But let's stay friends forever

forever



Here I stand and face the rain

I know that nothing's gonna be the same again

I fear for what tomorrow brings

Here I stand and face the pain

Of knowing nothings gonna be the same again

I fear for what tomorrow brings

Here I stand and face the rain

Knowing nothing's gonna be the same again

...

Here I stand and face the rain

Knowing nothing's gonna be the same

Again


>> ateens

I've been cheated by you since I don't know when

So I made up my mind, it must come to an end

Look at me now, will I ever learn?

I don't know how but I suddenly lose control

There's a fire within my soul

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring

One more look and I forget everything, w-o-o-o-oh



Mamma mia, here I go again

My my, how can I resist you?

Mamma mia, does it show again?

My my, just how much I've missed you

Yes, I've been brokenhearted

Blue since the day we parted

Why, why did I ever let you go?

Mamma mia, now I really know,

My my, I could never let you go.



I've been angry and sad about things that you do

I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through

And when you go, when you slam the door

I think you know that you won't be away too long

You know that I'm not that strong.

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring

One more look and I forget everything, w-o-o-o-oh



Mamma mia, here I go again

My my, how can I resist you?

Mamma mia, does it show again?

My my, just how much I've missed you

Yes, I've been brokenhearted

Blue since the day we parted

Why, why did I ever let you go?

Mamma mia, now I really know,

My my, I could never let you go.

Half past twelve

And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone

How I hate to spend the evening on my own

Autumn winds

Blowing outside my window as I look around the room

And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there

No one to hear my prayer



Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight

Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight

Take me through the darkness to the break of the day



Movie stars

Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win

It's so different from the world I'm living in

Tired of T.V.

I open the window and I gaze into the night

But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

There's not a soul out there

No one to hear my prayer



Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight

Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight

Take me through the darkness to the break of the day



Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...



There's not a soul out there

No one to hear my prayer



Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight

Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight

Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight


Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me

But I won't feel blue

Like I always do

'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you



I was sick and tired of everything

When I called you last night from Glasgow

All I do is eat and sleep and sing

Wishing every show was the last show

(Wishing every show was the last show)

So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming

(Glad to hear you're coming)

Suddenly I feel all right

(And suddenly it's gonna be)

And it's gonna be so different

When I'm on the stage tonight



Tonight the

Super Trouper lights are gonna find me

Shining like the sun

(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)

Smiling, having fun

(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)

Feeling like a number one

Tonight the

Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me

But I won't feel blue

(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)

Like I always do

(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)

'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you



Facing twenty thousand of your friends

How can anyone be so lonely

Part of a success that never ends

Still I'm thinking about you only

(Still I'm thinking about you only)

There are moments when I think I'm going crazy

(Think I'm going crazy)

But it's gonna be alright

(You'll soon be changing everything)

Everything will be so different

When I'm on the stage tonight



Tonight the

Super Trouper lights are gonna find me

Shining like the sun

(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)

Smiling, having fun

(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)

Feeling like a number one

Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me

But I won't feel blue

(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)

Like I always do

(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)

'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you



So I'll be there when you arrive

The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive

And when you take me in your arms

And hold me tight

I know it's gonna mean so much tonight



Tonight the

Super Trouper lights are gonna find me

Shining like the sun

Smiling, having fun

Feeling like a number one

Tonight the

Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me

But I won't feel blue

They passed me by, all of those great romances

You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances

My picture clear, everything seemed so easy

And so I dealt you the blow

One of us had to go

Now it's different, I want you to know



One of us is crying

One of us is lying

In her lonely bed

Staring at the ceiling

Wishing she was somewhere else instead

One of us is lonely

One of us is only

Waiting for a call

Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small

Wishing she had never left at all



I saw myself as a concealed attraction

I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action

Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving

That's how I started the show

One of us had to go

Now I've changed and I want you to know

One of us is crying

One of us is lying

In her lonely bed

Staring at the ceiling

Wishing she was somewhere else instead

One of us is lonely

One of us is only

Waiting for a call

Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small

Wishing she had never left at all

Never left at all



Staring at the ceiling

Wishing she was somewhere else instead

One of us is lonely

One of us is only

Waiting for a call

Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small

Wishing she had never left at all






People everywhere

A sense of expectation hanging in the air

Giving out a spark

Across the room your eyes are glowing in the dark

And here we go again, we know the start, we know the end

Masters of the scene

We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more

You know what I mean



Voulez-vous (ah-ha)

Take it now or leave it (ah-ha)

Now is all we get (ah-ha)

Nothing promised, no regrets

Voulez-vous (ah-ha)

Ain't no big decision (ah-ha)

You know what to do (ah-ha)

La question c'est voulez-vous

Voulez-vous...



I know what you think

"The girl means business so I'll offer her a drink"

Looking mighty proud

I see you leave your table, pushing through the crowd

I'm really glad you came, you know the rules, you know the game

Master of the scene

We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more

You know what I mean



Voulez-vous (ah-ha)

Take it now or leave it (ah-ha)

Now is all we get (ah-ha)

Nothing promised, no regrets

Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find

I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind

Whatever happened to our love?

I wish I understood

It used to be so nice, it used to be so good



So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me

S. O. S.

The love you gave me, nothing else can save me

S. O. S.

When you're gone

How can I even try to go on?

When you're gone

Though I try how can I carry on?



You seem so far away though you are standing near

You made me feel alive, but something died I fear

I really tried to make it out

I wish I understood

What happened to our love, it used to be so good



So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me

S. O. S.

The love you gave me, nothing else can save me

S. O. S.

When you're gone

How can I even try to go on?

When you're gone

Though I try how can I carry on?

You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life

See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the Dancing Queen



Friday night and the lights are low

Looking out for the place to go

Where they play the right music, getting in the swing

You come in for a king

Anybody could be that guy

Night is young and the music's high

With a bit of rock music, everything is fine

You're in the mood for a dance

And when you get the chance...



You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen

Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine

You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life

See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the Dancing Queen



You're a teaser, you turn 'em on

Leave them burning and then you're gone

Looking out for another, anyone will do

You're in the mood for a dance

And when you get the chance...



You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen

Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine

You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life

See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the Dancing Queen



Dig in the Dancing Queen 

Dig in the Dancing Queen 

Dig in the Dancing Queen

Listen to some music, maybe just talking, get to know you better

Don't go wasting your emotion

Lay all your love on me



I wasn't jealous before we met

Now every woman I see is a potential threat

And I'm possessive, it isn't nice

You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

But now it isn't true

Now everything is new

And all I've learned has overturned

I beg of you...

Don't go wasting your emotion

Lay all your love on me



It was like shooting a sitting duck

A little small talk, a smile and baby I was stuck

I still don't know what you've done with me

A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

I feel a kind of fear

When I don't have you near

Unsatisfied, I skip my pride

I beg you dear...



Don't go wasting your emotion

Lay all your love on me

Don't go sharing your devotion

Lay all your love on me



Don't go wasting your emotion

Lay all your love on me

Don't go wasting your emotion

Lay all your love on me

Don't go sharing your devotion

Lay all your love on me




I've seen you twice, in a short time

Only a week since we started

It seems to me, for every time

I'm getting more open-hearted



I was an impossible case

No-one ever could reach me

But I think I can see in your face

There's a lot you can teach me

So I wanna know..



What's the name of the game?

Does it mean anything to you?

What's the name of the game?

Can you feel it the way I do?

Tell me please, 'cause I have to know

I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow



And you make me talk

And you make me feel

And you make me show

What I'm trying to conceal

If I trust in you, would you let me down?

Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?

Could you feel the same way too?

I wanna know..



The name of the game

(Your smile and the sound of your voice)

Does it mean anything to you? 

(Got a feeling you give me no choice)

But it means a lot, what's the name of the game? 

(Your smile and the sound of your voice)

Can you feel it the way I do?

Tell me please, 'cause I have to know

I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow



And you make me talk

And you make me feel

And you make me show

What I'm trying to conceal

If I trust in you, would you let me down?

Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?

Could you feel the same way too?

I wanna know..

Oh yes I wanna know..



The name of the game 

(I was an impossible case)

Does it mean anything to you? 

(But I think I can see in your face)

That it means a lot

What's the name of the game? 

(Your smile and the sound of your voice)

Can you feel it the way I do? 

(Got a feeling you give me no choice)

But it means a lot, what's the name of the game? 

(I was an impossible case)

Does it mean anything to you? 

(But I think I can see in your face)

That it means a lot

Opened my eyes and made me see you babe 

What real love can be

(Love. Once you've tasted love) 

Don't be sold a dream. Remember how the past has been 
Don't be led to believe thias one's for you 
Calculate your needs. I see there's room to plant your seeds 
Don't decide till you see how the others have grown 

Once you've tasted love it is just the beggining of a new world 
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in 
Once you've tasted love 

Still too early to know. Give them time and they will grow 
Don't believe that the first's the one for you 
Most will grow to be tall, others will break and fall 
Keep your eye on the strongest head of them all 

Once you've tasted love it is just the beggining of a new world 
Once you've tasted love it is just the beggining 
Your head is spinning 
Once you've tasted love 

Once you've tasted love it is just the beggining of a new world 
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in 
Can't control your mind and your head is still spinning 
Once you've tasted love is just the beggining 
Once you've tasted love 

Once you've tasted love, you know is good 
Come taste my love 
You know you should 


Came into my world and the badness dissapeared 
Take my hand, don't be afraid, I'm gonna work off all your fears 
It feels so nice to be with you. Us two, we feel like a glove 
When I see your eyes I realise you too have tasted love 

Once you've tasted love, you know it's good 
Come taste my love 
You know you should


It only takes a minute girl 



It only takes a minute girl 

To fall in love, to fall in love 

It only takes a minute girl 

To fall in love, to fall in love 



What's an hour of the day 

We throw at least one away 

And walk the streets for half the year 

To try to find a new career 

If you get a flu attack 

For thirty days you're on your back 

Doing not a single dance 

Baby give me half a chance 



It only takes a minute girl 

To fall in love, to fall in love 

It only takes a minute girl 

To fall in love, to fall in love 



Now in the unemployment lines 

You can spend your life reading signs 

Waiting for your interview 

They can shoot the whole day for you 



Now winter's gonna turn to spring 

And you haven't accomplished a thing 

So baby can't you make me just a little time 

Cause you never know what's on my mind 



It only takes a minute girl 

To fall in love, to fall in love 

It only takes a minute girl 

To fall in love, to fall in love 



Dance, come on now 

Dance, come n now


Put your head against my life 
What do you hear 
A million words just trying to make 
The love song of the year 
Close your eyes but don't forget 
What you have heard 
A man who's trying to say three words 
The words that make me scared 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
And here I am 
Looking to the future now 
This is what I see 
A million chances pass me by 
A million chances to hold you 
Take me back, take me back 
To where I used to be 
To hide away from all my truth 
Through the light I see 

A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
And here I am.


Baby I'm watching you to see 

I don't like the way you've been treating me 

I promised you nothing and gave you much more 

Making love is all you wanted me for 



You're never satisfied, you're never satisfied 

If you open your mind you'll see 

That you could be satisfied with me 



Baby you criticize my every move 

Look, can't you see I've nothing to prove 

I've had enough, it's a matter of time 

Maybe we'll make it somewhere down the line 



You can be if you wanna be 



I often wonder what I see in you 

You don't do the things that I want you to do 

I open my eyes and dream it's alright 

Maybe we'll make it together tonight.


I'm tired of closing my eyes, to picture you in my mind 

It feels so cold to be alone 

Not sure where I want to be, so close to finding my dream 

We need to hold on to all the times we spoke of love 

Now I pray to God above that someday I can find the door 

I'm looking for 



I can make it, I know I can 

I can save this love forever 

I can make I know I can 

We can make this work together 



It's not a lonely men's dream,it's just that now that there's been 

A taste of love in my life 

That I refuse to return, I've got so much to learn 

How can it feels as though I've reached the top of this steep hill 

For a moment I was standing still 

Now I have the faith I've needed to believe 



'Cause you knop what this love means to me 

You know how it feels when I can see it in your face 

That you're missing me now, you feel I've let you down 

You've gotta hold on, you've gota reach out and believe 



I can make this world a place for me and you 

We can make it, we can make it together


Sugar sweet, if only they all knew 
Jam, can't spread no more you've took my bread 
Energy, just work, no rest or play 
Me, myself I'd rather be alone again 


So you can do what you like -Do what you like 
No need to ask me -Do what you want 
Do what you like -Do what you like 
No need to tell me -Do what you want 

Cherry pie, you're not as cute as me 
Ice, could never be as cold as you 
Recipe, you stir me up inside 
Me, myself I'd rather be alone again 




Standing back I can't believe how you've led me on 
And judging by the things you say 
There's gotta be something wrong 


What you telling me that for you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
I wanna know 

Seems that I've been playing your game 
And how you think you've won 
But when you count up what you've gained you're the lonely one 



I'll never know 
What you telling me for. 


Can't decide if I should read or think 
I'll keep an open mind, till the day sets in 
Hear you call me, I'm so willing to call back 
Hear you thinking, hope you hear me thinking too 


Why can't I wake up with you 
S you're there when I open my eyes 
Baby why can't I wake up with you 
You're my life 

I feel alive, so I'll just begin 
Te rest my mind, before you ring me 
Hear you thinking, hope you hear me thinking too 



So good to be near you, so dark when you walk from my side 
Baby why can't I wake up with you, you're my life, you're my life


Lying here beside you, in a cloud of warmth 

I've been awake all night but move 

Though I know I should 

Counting curls n your hair, as you sleep so tight 

I wonder if you'll ever know 'till I go 

The chances are you'll be there too some day 

We'll never know, let's hope 





Never wanna let you go 

Never wanna let you go 

All I can do is hope 

'Cause I never wanna let me go 



Dreaming soft in silence, been working hard all day 

Still in the night grows darker, I'm with you in every way 







I don't know whether I'm trying to love, love you baby 

Been round long enough to know

She leads a lonely life

She leads a lonely life



When she woke up late in the morning light

And the day had just begun

She opened up her eyes and thought

Oh what a morning

It's not a day for work

It's a day for catching tan

Just laying on the beach and having fun

She's goning to get you



All that she wants is another baby

She's gone tomorrow boy

All that she wants is another baby

All that she wants is another baby

She's gone tomorrow boy

All that she wants is another baby 

All that she wants - all that she wants



So if you are in sight and the day is right

She's the hunter you're the fox

The gentle voice that talks to you won't talk forever

It is a night for passion

But the morning means goodbye

Beware of what is flashing in her eyes

She's going to get you



All that she wants...


I will survive without you

Don't tell me that you wanna leave

If you wanna leave
I won't beg you to stay
And if you gotta go darling
Maybe it's better that way
I'm gonna be strong
I'm gonna do fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
Just walk out the door
See if I care
Go on and go, but

Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
But I won't let you know
I won't let you know

I won't miss your arms around me
Holding me tight
And if you ever think about me
Just know that I'll be alright
I'm gonna be strong
I'm gonna do fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
I will survive
I'll make it through
I'll even learn to live without you

Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
But I won't let you know

I wish I could scream out loud
That I love you
I wish I could say to you
Don't go
As he walks away
He feels the pain getting strong
People in your life
They don't know what's going on
Too proud to turn around
He's gone

Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go

Baby don't turn around
Don't turn around
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving 
But I'm letting you go
Don't turn around


We're much too young

Andd life's so big

We don't know yet what the future brings in it's hands for us

What tomarrow brings the future knows



No matter what you say

No matter what you do

We are united



Young and Proud

Young and Proud

We're on the same side of destiny

On the same side of destiny



Anyway anyway you do it wrong

I'm calling out your name

But you never hear me

Anyway anyway you do it wrong

I'm giving you my love

Though it's never for sale



Anyway anyway...


Shock!

I got a new life
You would hardly recognize me I'm so glad
How could a person like me care for you
Why do I bother
When you're not the one for me
Oooo, is enough, enough

I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong

Under the pale moon
For so many years I've wondered who you are
How can a person like you bring me joy
Under the pale moon
Where I see a lot of stars
Is enough, enough

I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong

Oh, oh, oh, oh.

I saw the sign and it opened up my mind
And I am happy now living without you
I've left you, ooohhh
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong

I saw the sign - I saw the sign - I saw the sign
I saw the sign - I saw the sign
I saw the sign - I saw the sign - I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes I saw the sign


Live for yourself, it's a wonderful thing

You can so what you want, you can live in a dream

Get in, get up, get the rhythm, get down



You're living your life in peace and in harmony

You making your own desisions

That's how it's got to be for you and me

So many people are running around and 'round

Without no sense of logic



I see lies

In the eyes of a stranger

Woah

You'll be living in danger

In the eyes of a stranger

Woah

You'll be living in danger

In the eyes of a stranger

Woah

You'll be living in danger



People are the same today as they used to be

The same expectations

So high no one can reach that high

Not I nor you get satisfied today

We'll never get enough



In the eyes of a stranger...


What an odd situation

What an odd situation



What you got is basic emotions can you feel them

I want to be your lover but you're so shy

What you need is perfect assistance let me guide you

To a land you've never seen before



I guess you see that I have another daydream

I guess you see that I have another daydream



Come and be a dancer

Dance into my daydream

Join me in my daydream wet and wild



Come and be a dancer

Dance into my daydream

Join me in the jungle wet and wild



To help another person will make you feel important

You got my invitaion but you're so shy

Come and let your wild side show and be a dancer

A dancer in a daydream we can share



I guess you see...



Help me take control of my fool imagination

I'm looking for a man that will wathch my situtaion

I'm thinking abou the people waiting down the line

I am in the limelight now's my time



I guess you see...



What you gonna do I'm a bold explosion


What you gonna tell your dad

It's like a wheel of fortune

And what you gonna tell your dad

If this wheel lets you down

My love is my engine

And you might be fuel

Stop acting cool

Just bet you might win

I'm not too cool

(I'm in love with another fool)



Don't push me

I don't wat to can't you see it

Hasten slowly

And don't count your chicks

before the're hatched baby



What you gonna tell your...



Hey you...

We're gonna make you move

It tastes like steel

Like a stab from a knife



What you gonna tell your...

I'm on love with another fool



I'm in love with you I like your style

I want you I'm in love



What you gonna tell your...


Kiss me baby I am snow white sleeping in a coffin

Waiting for you - Waiting for magic

Baby I am snow white sleeping in a coffin

Waiting for you - Waiting for Magic



A man of the world but lost in a dream

You look at something from a different angle

But I exist I'm waiting for you

In a coffin made of glass



Kiss me baby I'm attractive

Baby get to know me

Show who you are

Give me that magic

Baby I'm eternal

Lying in a coffin

Waiting for you



In your dream a girl is dancing close to you (that girl is me)

Once a witch made her sleep but a prince will wakr her up that's you



Kiss me baby...



In the tale is the place to find her

Reach out to get to know her

It means so much to me

The meaning of the book



Oh, kiss me baby wake me up

Oh, kiss me baby wake me up

Join the story of the fairytale

Believe the dream you will not fail

Oh, kiss me baby wake me up



Kiss me baby...

Waiting for magic it's what I do

Waiting for magic for me and you

Oh, kiss me baby wake me up



Cought in a dream how lucky you are

You can see me I'm the girl behind you

So open your eyes and turn around

And watch me dancing join the fairytales



Kiss me baby...



You cannot reach her on the planet

That scientist want to call earth

But if you use your imagination

You will see her

You will find her in your dreams



I see no shadows in my dreams

It is something so romanitic

I can tell it's for real you'll see


Laudate omnes gentes laudate

Magnificat en secula

Et anima mea laudate

Magnificat en secuala



Happy nation living in a happy nation

Where people understand

And dream of the perfect man

A situation leading to sweet salvation

For the people for the good

For mankind brotherhood



We're traveling in time



Ideas by man and only that will last

And over time we've turned to the past

That no man's fit to rule the world alone

A man will die but not his ideas



Happy nation...



We're traveling in time

Traveling in time



Tell them we've gone too far

Tell them we've gone too far

Happy nation come through

And I will dance with you

Happy nation



Happy nation...


I knew you before about five years ago

Then you seemed to be like a person

Who did'nt act like the people I knew

Yet something was special about 'ya

A bit insecure but still kind of cute

At the same time easy to talk to

And now I see you again

And you're looking so good



Voulez-vous danser avec moi

Voulez-vous dancer avec moi se soir



I look in the mirror and what do I see

You're the same kind of person you're like me

And I can't run away I'm so attracted to you



Voulez-vous danser avec moi

Voulez-vous dancer avec moi se soir



No more hesitation you're what I've bee looking for

So stay close to me I want to give you a better life

L'amour eternelle

L'amour eternelle



Voulez-vous danser...

Yo listen up here's a story
About a little guy that lives in a blue world
And all day and all night and everything he sees
Is just blue like him inside and outside
Blue is his house with a blue little window
And a blue corvette
And everything is blue for him and himself
And everybody around
'cause he ain't got nobody to listen to

I'm blue da ba dee da ba die...

I have a blue house with a blue window.
Blue is the colour of all that I wear.
Blue are the streets and all the trees are too.
I have a girlfriend and she is so blue.
Blue are the people here that walk around,
Blue like my corvette, it's standing outside.
Blue are the words I say and what I think.
Blue are the feelings that live inside me.

Tu non rispondi più al telefono
E appendi al filo ogni speranza mia
Io non avrei creduto mai di poter perder la testa per te
E all'improvviso sei fuggito via
Lasciando il vuoto in questa vita mia
Senza risposte ai miei perché adesso cosa mi resta di te

Non c'è il profumo della tua pelle
Non c'è il respiro di te sul viso
Non c'è la tua bocca di fragola
Non c'è il dolce miele dei tuoi capelli
Non c'è che il veleno di te nel cuore
Non c'è via d'uscita per questo amore
Non c'è non c'è vita per me, pi
Non c'è non c'è altra ragione che mi
Liberi l'anima

Incantenata a notti di follia 
Anche in prigione me ne andrei per te
Solo una vita non basta per me 

E anche l'estate ha le sue nuvole
E tu sei l'uragano contro me
Strappando i sogni ai giorni miei te ne sei andato di fretta perché

Non c'è non c'è che il veleno di te nel cuore
Non c'è via d'uscita per questo amore
Non c'è non c'è vita per me, più
Non c'è non c'è altra ragione per me

Se esiste un Dio non può scordarsi di me anche se
Fra lui e me c'è un cielo nero nero senza fine
Lo pregherò lo cercherò e lo giuro ti troverò
Dovessi entrare in altre dieci cento mille vite

In questa vita buia senza di te sento che
Ormai per me sei diventeto l'unica ragione
Se c'è un confine nell'amore giuro lo passerò
E nell'imenso vuoto di quei giorni senza fine
Ti amerò

Come la prima volta a casa tua
Ogni tuo gesto mi portava via
Sentivo perdermi dentro di te

Non c'è il profumo della tua pelle
Non c'è il respiro di te sul viso
Non c'è la tua bocca di fragola
Non c'è il dolce miele dei tuoi capelli

Non c'è che il veleno di te nel cuore 
Non c'è via d'uscita per questo amore 
Non c'è non c'è vita per me, più
Non c'è non c'è altra ragione per me

Non c'è che il veleno di te nel cuore 
Non c'è via d'uscita per questo amore 
Non c'è non c'è vita per me, più
Non c'è non c'è altra ragione per me


Scrivo sul quaderno è tutto tempo perso e tu
Che sei aldilà del mare ed io non ho che te
Qui dentro l'anima
Disfo le valigie e chiamo le mie amiche e poi

Ho ancora da studiare ed io che cerco te in quelle pagine
Da domani tutto come sempre tornerà
La gente il traffico in città
Non voglio amare più così

Come vorrei odiarti farti anche del mare, ma
Vorrei soltanto averti qui
Con me non voglio amare più così
Io senza te che vita è

Ogni sera esco e tu sei li che guardi me
Da quella foto al mare ed io ti chiuderei in una scatola
Mi ha telefonato quella che non amolla mai
Ma se l'amassi forse io potrei con lei dimenticare te

Poi delle vacanze quanto se ne parlerà
Storie leggere dell'età non voglio amare più così
Voglio anche scherzare non drammatizzare ma
Più parlo e più ti vedo qui con me non voglio amare più così

Io senza te che vita è
Non voglio amare più così


La solitudine è un peccato
Per tutti quelli come me
Che nella vita hanno perduto
Un grande amore dentro se

Quando quel giorno mi hai lasciato
Salendo in macchina con lei
Hai detto addio alla mia alegria
E in questa vita sto toccando il fondo

Dimmi dove sei
Adesso cerco adesso inseguo te
Nei giorni miei
Mi manchi come mai

Sento il telefono suonare
Penso ogni volta che sei tu
Cerco qualcosa da mangiare
Ma proprio niente mi va giù

Quando l'amore ti fa male
Non puoi resistere di più
Ma come me c'è una tribù
Di gente che alla fine non si arrende

Dimmi dove sei
adesso che ti sto cercando
In tutti i giorni miei

Per te cosa darei ti prego

Dimmi dove sei
Da solo al mondo sto morendo
Aiutami se puoi
Mi manchi come mai

Sento che ci sei
Nell'aria della cità
Non lo saprò mai
Se è un sogno oppure realtà

Dimmi dove sei
Adesso che ti sto cercando 
In tutti i giorni miei
Per te cosa darei ti prego

Dimmi dove sei

Per tutti quelli come me
La solitudine non è
Che una crudele schiavitù

Adesso sento che ci sei
In tutti sogni miei
Ti prego dimmi dove sei
Ti prego dimmi dove sei


Partiro quando dorme ancora la città
Nell'aria fresca con la macchina che va
Chissà se ci sarà quest'anno
Quel ragazzo in discoteca al molo

Come pirati che si appostano nei bar
Ragazzi mettono il tuo cuore in trappola
C'è musica che va nel buio
Chiudi gli occhi e cadi dentro a un guaio

Baci che si rubano
E la pioggia su di noi
In questo mare dire
Amore è una bugia
Che vola via innocente

Voci che si giurano
Di non lasciarsi mai
Su quelle spiagge
Giorno e notte più affolate che in città

Il sole con gli occhiali scuri se ne andrà
È il gioco antico degli sguardi inizierà
Le compagnie che fanno tardi
La mattina in spiaggia siamo zombi

Quanti tramonti che non scorderemo mai
Quanti maglioni messi sulle spalle e poi
Quelle carezze sulla sabbia
Sono un faro accesso nella nebbia

Baci che si rubano
E la pioggia su di noi
In questo mare amaro
Amore di un addio
Che fugge via per sempre

Voci che si giurano
Di non lasciarsi mai
Ma già le spiagge sono vuote
E questa estate se ne va

Ora che la vita è stretta
Da questa realtà
Per tutto un anno il cuore aspetta solo
Quella libertà


Sento che è più forte di me
Questa notte parla già da sé
E questa volta tu hai
Deciso anche per me

Ma di sicuro non so cosa fare
Ho un po' paura ma vorrei provare
Un emozione di più
Dovrei lasciarmi andare

Perché tutt'al più
Potresti farmi male tu
Ma potrei farti del male anch'io
Oh no, io no

Tutt'al più
Dirò che è stata colpa mia
Dirò che è stata una follia
Che l'ho cercata e l'ho voluto io

Tutt'al più
Stanotte ti diverti tu
Domani forse rido io
Perchè domani sarò donna anch'io

Tutt'al più

E continuo a chiedermi se
Se non è amore allora che cos'è
Irresistibile follia di

Restare con te

Almeno dimmi che mi scalderai
Stringimi forte quando finirai
E giuralo anche tu
Che non me lascerai

Perché tutt'al più
Potresti farmi male tu
Ma potrei farti del male anch'io
Oh no, io no

Tutt'al più
Dirò che è stata colpa mia
Dirò che è stata una follia
Che l'ho cercata e l'ho voluto io

Tutt'al più
Stanotte ti diverti tu
Domani forse rido io
Perchè domani sarò donna anch'io

Tutt'al più

Stanotte ti diverti tu
Domani forse rido io
Perchè domani sarò donna anch'io
Tutt'al più


Marco se n'è andato e non ritorna più
Il treno delle sette e trenta senza lui
È un cuore di metallo senza l'anima
Nel freddo del matino grigio di città

A scuola il banco è vuoto, Marco è dentro me
È dolce il suo respiro fra i pensieri miei
Distanze enormi sembrano dividerci
Ma il cuore batte forte dentro me

Chissà se tu mi penserai
Se con i tuoi non parli mai
Se ti nascondi come me
Sfuggi gli sguardi e te ne stai

Rinchiuso in camera e non vuoi mangiare
Stringi forte al te il cuscino
Piangi non lo sai
Quanto altro male ti farà la solitudine

Marco nel mio diario ho una fotografia
Hai occhi d'un bambino un poco timido
La stringo forte al cuore e sento che ci sei
Fra i compiti d'inglese e matematica

Tuo padre e i suoi consigli che monotonia
Lui con il suo lavoro ti ha portato via
Di certo il tuo parere non l'ha chiesto mai
Ha detto: "un giorno tu mi capirai"

Chissà se tu mi penserai
Se con gli amici parlerai
Per non soffrire più per me
Ma non è facile lo sai

A scuola non me posso più
E i pomeriggi senza te
Studiare è inutile tutte le idee
Si affollano su te

Non è possibile dividere
La vita di noi due
Ti prego aspettami amore mio
Ma illuderti non so

La solitudine fra noi
Questo silenzio dentro me
è l'inquietudine di vivere
La vita senza te

Ti prego aspettami perché
Non posso stare senza te
Non è possibile dividere
La storia di noi due

La solitudine fra noi
Questo silenzio dentro me
è l'inquietudine di vivere
La vita senza te

Ti prego aspettami perché
Non posso stare senza te
Non è possibile dividere
La storia di noi due
La solitudine


Odiami
Ridi anche di me
Butta via
Questa vita mia

Ma senza te
Cos'altro c'è
Puoi non amarmi
Ma torna insieme a me

Ti aspetterò
Finché vivrò
Ma perché questo cuore non si arrende

E i tuoi jeans
Io mi metterò
Poi prenderò
Quella tua fotografia

La stringerò
Come stringo te
Ma perché
Il mio cuore non si arrende

Domani no
Non mi alzerò
Non so pensare
A un giorno senza te

Si è fatto già mattino
Sulla città
E in questo cuore
È inverno già

Domani no
Non mi alzerò
Come fa male
La libertà


Odiami
Ridi anche di me
Butta via
Questa vita mia

Ma senza te
Cos'altro c'è
Puoi non amarmi
Ma torna insieme a me

Ti aspetterò
Finché vivrò
Ma perché
Questo cuore non si arrende

E i tuoi jeans
Io mi metterò
Poi prenderò
Quella tua fotografia

La stringerò
Come stringo te
Ma perché
Il mio cuore non si arrende

Domani no
Non mi alzerò
Non so pensare
A un giorno senza te

Si è fatto già mattino
Sulla città
E in questo cuore
È inverno già

Domani no
Non mi alzerò
Come fa male
La libertà


Si sbaglia sai quasi continuamente
Sperando di non farsi mai troppo male
Ma quante volte si cade

La vita sai è un filo in equilibrio
E prima o poi ci ritroviamo distanti
Davanti a un bivio

Ed ogni giorno insieme per fare solo un metro in più
Ci vuole tutto il bene che riusciremo a trovare in ognuno di noi

Ma a volte poi basta un sorriso solo
A sciogliere in noi anche un inverno di gelo
E ripartire da zero

Perché non c'è un limite per nessuno
Che dentro sé abbia un amore sincero
Solo un respiro

Non siamo angeli in volo venuti dal cielo
Ma gente comune che ama davvero
Gente che vuole un mondo più vero
La gente che incontri per strada in città

Prova e vedrai ci sarà sempre un modo
Dentro di noi per poi riprendere il volo
Verso il sereno

Non siamo angeli in volo venuti dal cielo
Ma gente comune che ama davvero
Gente che vuole un mondo più vero
La gente che insieme lo cambierà

Gente che vuole un mondo più vero
La gente che insieme lo cambierà

Insieme lo cambierà, proverà
Gente che proverà
Lavorerà, cambierà, riuscirà
Gente che riuscirà
Insieme ci riuscirà, cambierà
Gente che cambierà


Lui non sta con te
Cara amica timida
Ma ti guarda e
Non sa più dov'è

Lei non sta con te
Caro amico no non c'è
Nessun dubbio che
Ha capito tutto

E sarà un amore
Anche se ancora non lo sai
Ma in tutti gesti e le parole
Ora senti che si ferma il cuore
Senza più il rumore della gente intorno a te
Ed il passare delle ore che va via
In compagnia

Parlagli di te
Non aver paura di
Dire quello che
Hai nell'anima

E sarà un amore
Sarà come lo vorrai
Avrà parole sempre nuove
Giorni interi da passare insieme
Occhi innamorati negli abbracci che darai
Nel sole di quei pomeriggi senza età

Ma fai attenzione
È facile farsi del male
Anche se non si vuole
Quando è l'inizio di un amore

Lui non sta con te
Cara amica timida
Lei non sta con te
Ma un amore nuovo c'è

Cascading down
There's a sound vaporising into vision
It's a sound in my head
That I feel and it shuts me in a prison

Say it won't last
Say it will pass
Always the sound in my brain
Can you hear it

Water on glass running down again
Water on glass that sound
Water on glass running round again
Help me, the sound of running water's
Coming down

Dancing away
Like the lights on a moving coloured river
Sounds in my head seem to run
And again I feel a shiver

Say it won't last
Pray it will pass
Always that sound in my brain
Can you hear it (Can you hear it)

Water on glass running down again
Water on glass that sound
Water on glass running round again
Help me, the sound of running water's
Coming down

Water on glass running down again
Water on glass that sound
Water on glass running round again
Help me, the sound of running water's
Coming down


This is your town, this is my place
This is where my whole world is lived in
Nothing much, and just out of reach of all the city lights
It's a high town, it's a low town
It's get here, come on you grow town
No-one does, but everyone thinks they're gonna make it soon
This is one place I respected
Now I feel it's really dejected
No-one cares and the people just stare
And a man on the box says
"Hey you, don't walk away, vote for me
You'll get more pay, keep working hard"
But they work slow

Here it comes now, Sunday morning
Just another sleepy town yawning
Down below everything looks just like another day
But, in the warm glow of the sunrise
There's a child who's searching with young eyes
Looking 'round and feeling inside he's gonna fly away
There was one time I was leaving
But the folks around me kept grieving
Friends said go, but my dad said no
And my mum kept saying
"Don't go, don't go away
Don't leave us, you've got to stay
Just raise them kids, oh mother no"

No prospects, just projects
Don't try to tell me we're living
There's no real need to try
Can't you see this town gonna die

Hail the new age, it's a rat cage
Join the place for breeding dumb spieces
All stacked up and doing whatever someone tells you to
Burn the place down, make it dead ground
Show the people just what they're missing
Wake up, wake up, can't you believe in what I'm telling you
There's a house where I was born in
Now it's changed without any warning
Cranes just crash and bricks just smash
While a billboard's saying
"Let's go, let's get away
Come fly me, you've weeks to pay
When sunshine calls, but I won't go

This is our town


Don't bring your gun 'round here
Don't need you mouthing off your fear
It touches all you can build a wall
We all have tasted tears

Everything we know
Everything we know
Everything we know
Everywhere we go

We walked along the beach
Once lovers now we're out of reach
Windy skies, they kissed me goodbye
It takes experience to teach

Everything we know
Everything we know
Everything we know
Everywhere we go

Nobody laughed today
I went to watch the children play
Their smiles and mine were frozen in time
I'll just remember them that way

Everything we know
Everything we know
Everything we know
Everywhere we go


Everyone round keeps putting us down, let it go
It's the same old play in a grown up day
It's a stinging sensation
Hanging round on every corner
Where, all the young kids I know want to be

We only wanna stay young, we only wanna be free
He doesn't wanna be you, she doesn't wanna be me
We're all young heroes
We're all young heroes

Shouted down pushed and we're gettin' real bushed
Just have your say and we'll do it your way
If it makes you fell better
Nothing much to add to what I say
'cause I know just how it fells to be

We only wanna stay young, we only wanna be free
He doesn't wanna be you, she doesn't wanna be me
We're all young heroes
We're all young heroes

We only wanna be free


Looking out a dirty old window
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why

Friday night and everyone's moving
I can feel the heat but it's soothing, heading down
I search for the beat in this dirty town

Downtown the young ones are going
Downtown the young ones are growing
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
Everybody live for the music-go-round

Bright lights, the music gets faster
Look, boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance
I'm not leaving now, honey, not a chance

Hot-shot, give me no problems
Much later, baby, you'll be saying nevermind
You know life is cruel, life is never kind

Kind hearts don't make a new story
Kind hearts don't grab any glory
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
Everybody live for the music-go-round

La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la (Sing)
La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la

Come closer, honey, that's better
Got to get a brand new experience, feeling right
Oh, don't try to stop, baby, hold me tight

Outside a new day is dawning
Outside suburbia's sprawling everywhere
I don't want to go, baby

New York to east California
There's a new wave coming, I warn ya
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
Everybody lives for the music-go-round

La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la (Sing)
La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la

We're the kids
We're the kids
We're the kids in America
We're the kids
We're the kids
We're the kids in America
We're the kids
We're the kids
We're the kids in America


You say everything's alright
I say nothing can go right, yeah
Oh what a game you can play
Sad days add to confusion
Sad ways end in dillusion, yeah
That's the name of the game


Well I know your love is rough
And the road you take is tough
But I just can't get enough
Chequered love

Touch me, do what you want to
Say no, then, I just need you
Babe, your gonna drive me insane
You are man for all seasons
You are man with no reasons, yeah
You're the man with no pain



Oh I can't let go 
'cos I need you so tonight

You say everything's alright
I say nothing can go right, yeah
Oh what a game you can play
Sad days add to confusion
Sad ways end in dillusion, yeah
That's the name of the game

Well I know your love is rough
And the road you take is tough
But I just can't get enough
Chequered love

Oh I can't let go 
'cos I need you so tonight


I watch a man sitting down the park
The flashy suit manufactured by the makers
He's got a pen and he circles an add
It makes him laugh 'cos he's reading dirty papers

2-6-5-8-0

She doesn't know but she's getting his call
He's talking straight but he wants it in a strange way
She combs her hair doesn't worry at all
He could be mad but its just another pay day

2-6-5-8-0
2-6-5-8-0
2-6-5-8-0 Oh, dial it if you want to know me

She likes to live on the poor side of town
She's shacking down with a guy from West Guiana
The boys around always look at the ground
Oh, what they'd give for a night with that piranha

2-6-5-8-0
2-6-5-8-0
2-6-5-8-0 Oh, dial it if you want to know me

She doesn't have to make her money that way
She's such a pretty young girl
I guess they love it 'cos you hear when they stay
They cry oh, oh, oh

This guy arrives looking scared as a rat
He needs her love but he wants it like a brother
Three hours later he crawls out on his knees
She's laughing loud 'cos he's calling for his mother

2-6-5-8-0
2-6-5-8-0
2-6-5-8-0 Oh, dial it if you want to know me

2-6-5-8-0
2-6-5-8-0
2-6-5-8-0 Oh, dial it if you want to know me


Just two lovers in a seedy cafe
Someone's leaving, the waiter says "Hey, won't you wait"
Running nowhere, she hides in her room
What he told her had to get out and soon

It's just a bad affair you've had
No need to cry, don't take it bad
You'll soon be glad when you're far apart

You'll never be so wrong, not for a long time
You'll never be so wrong, not for a long time
'Cause I'm never gonna find that feeling again
I'm never gonna find that feeling again

Now she's breaking but what can she do
Somewhere out there a car disappears out of view
Fumbles somewhere for stale cigarettes
Looks for numbers, the ones she could dial but forgets

No point in you just looking down
No way that you can turn it around
You've go to realise youre free

You'll never be so wrong, not for a long time
You'll never be so wrong, not for a long time
'Cause I'm never gonna find that feeling again
I'm never gonna find that feeling again

No point in you just looking down
No way that you can turn it around
You've go to realise you're free

You'll never be so wrong, not for a long time
You'll never be so wrong, not for a long time
'Cause I'm never gonna find that feeling again
I'm never gonna find that feeling again


What can I say now after all is said and done
You cut me up in pieces when the shooting first begun
What did I do to you to make you turn away
'cause now there's nothing left for me
There's nothing I can say

Now it's too late you feeling sorry
You'll never change
And there's nothing you can do about it

Falling out - why did you do it to me, yeah
Falling out - cutting me up into pieces
Falling out - you know that you upset me, yeah
Falling out - you know that I'm so hurt baby

You said you loved me, I believed you for a while
You sure could fool the angels
When you use that painted smile
I should have known that it was too good to be true
But now that it's all over, you know I won't forget you

Now it's too late you feeling sorry
You'll never change
And there's nothing you can do about it

Falling out - why did you do it to me, yeah
Falling out - cutting me up into pieces
Falling out - you know that you upset me, yeah
Falling out - you know that I'm so hurt baby

So now it's over and there's nothing left to say
The flame that burned within my heart
Now slowly fades away
So don't you ever think of knocking at my door
Just turn the light out, close your eyes
And think of me no more

And it's too late to say you're sorry
You'll never change
And there's nothing you can do about it

Falling out - why did you do it to me, yeah
Falling out - cutting me up into pieces
Falling out - you know that you upset me, yeah
Falling out - you know that I'm so hurt baby


Cruising 'round there's a sound with a place to go
Tuning in tuning on like a radio
Fell the sound in your head and you set the seal
I believe it's a force of the life you feel - Tuning on

Do you know what the sounds that you hear will find
Reach to space to the stars and another time
I believe that they search like a seed to grow
In the end it's the same anyway you go

I really can't explain
I really can't explain

Crashing out for the last and the final time
Could a sound and a soul travel on combined
From the womb to the end is it everywhere
Feel the beat of my heart and you know it's there

I really can't explain


I really believe that sound reaches infinity, 
Do you know what I mean. 
I think it goes on and on forever, 
And if that's true 
And it was linked to the spiritual side of your lives, well, 
Then sounds could be alive. 
Can you imagine the possibilities for the future? 
Linking the soul and the sound and then being able 
To make a giant spiritual musical machine, 
Actually a part of us and not just something you hear 
- it's fantastic - it's just fantastic

I really can't explain

Qui pense à l'amour, à l'amour
Qui pense à l'amour, à l'amour
On se perd dans ce boulot d'enfer
T'es comme un milliardaire
Elle a pas le temps
Sauf pour ses affaires
On est comme des courants d'air
À rebours le compteur de nos jours
Nous stressa toujours
Tu t'agites, tu cours ou tu flippes
On dit que c'est la vie d'artiste
Mais...

Qui pense à l'amour, à l'amour
Qui pense à l'amour, à l'amour

Si on pouvait s'arrêter
On jure qu'on le ferait
Mais au fond de nos sens
Y a la vie qui avance
Les gamins, les vacances
Pourquoi pas tout plaquer

Qui pense à l'amour, à l'amour
Qui pense à l'amour, à l'amour
Qui pense à l'amour, à l'amour
Qui pense à l'amour, à l'amour

Où va la vie
Y a des moments d'ennui
Où tu te demandes
Si t'as tout compris
Pourquoi on vit
Le coeur en transparence
Comme un oubli
Faut qu'on y pense...


On va faire tomber tous les murs
Entre l'amour et puis l'amour
Comme un retour vers le futur
Comme un premier bonheur du jour
Ressuciter l'espoir le plus fou
C'est comme un cri qui chante en nous
Mépriser l'arrogance
Faire parler les silences
En mots plus doux, plus tendres
Aimer ceux qui dérangent
Comme l'oiseau, je m'envole
Tout en moi se libère
Je n'ai plus de frontières
Folle, je ne suis pas folle
J'ai le coeur farandole
Et l'amour pour banière

Le temps va refaire notre histoire
Y'a plus de honte à ma mémoire
L'amour a guéri ses blessures
Il a fait tomber tous les murs
Ressusciter l'espoir le plus fou
C'est comme un cri qui chante en nous
Mépriser l'arrogance
Faire parler les silences
En mots plus doux, plus tendres
Mon bonheur est immense


Tu sais plus pourquoi t'es là
Si tu t'ressembles ou pas
T'oublies même de rêver la nuit
Tu téléphones aux hommes
Qui t'ont chanté la pomme
Tu t'prends à envier tes amis
Et tu t'demandes ce que tu fous là
Si repeindre ta chambre
Changerait tout ça

Pourquoi pas l'exotisme
Mets un maillot sympa
Prends le ton air d'actrice en vacances
Pourquoi pas
Pourquoi pas l'exotisme
L'Express San Francisco
Ouvres les yeux
Pourquoi faner dans ce ghetto

Lentement tu désespères
Tu t'perds dans ce désert
Entre un ordi et l'ordinaire
Tu déchaînes tes colères
Quand tu t'ramasses à terre
La galère n'a rien pour te plaire

Et tu tangues au beau milieu
De cette ville qui flanche
C'est quoi que tu veux

Oh, mais t'es si belle dans la tête
Même tes yeux
Sont le reflet d'une vie en fête
Oh, tu peux t'en aller
Sur une île du pacifique
Pourquoi pas l'exotisme


Je serai toujours là c'est une promesse
Que j'ai faite là comme une caresse
Les mots du coeur sont merveilleux
Je sais l'amour s'appelle nous deux
J'connais ton coeur, j'connais ton corps par coeur
Même quand tu blesses c'est la tendresse qui pleure
Faut que j'te dise à tout moment j'ai peur
Si peur de me brûler le coeur
J'm'arrêterai pas de t'aimer
Quoiqu'il arrive je sais
T'mentir ça m'sert à rien
Et tout te dire
Ça m'fait du bien

J'tai toujours dis la vérité
Celle d'aujourd'hui a tout changé
C'est le grand homme qui a décidé
Du reste il a fallu trancher

J'm'arrêterai pas de t'aimer
Ce sera mon petit secret
Comme un jardin discret
Qui voudrait fleurir
Dans ton coeur


Le jour où tu partiras
Bien plus loin qu'ici, ailleurs ou là-bas
Ce jour-là, au moins préviens moi
J'allumerai des bougies en mémoire de toi
Et comme tu les aimais tant
Ces odeurs de canelle
Je brûlerai de l'encens
Pour ton coeur infidèle
Ce n'est pas que je crains pour l'amour
Mais qu'à force de moi
Tu te lasses un beau jour
Je sais ton amour est discret
Il fantasme en secret
Mais l'amour c'est l'amour

Le jour où tu partiras
Prétextant sans complexes
L'abus de mes caresses
Ce jour là, j'accuserai tes bras
D'abandon de tendresse
Et de fausses promesses

Le jour où tu partiras
Quittant notre chez toi
Mon coeur voudra se taire
Dans ce vide qui m'encombre déjà
Sans l'écho de ta voix
Je serai prisonnière
Le jour où tu partiras
Laisse moi ton adresse
Je t'écrirai tendresse
Ce jour là au moins préviens moi
Je me poste chez moi
Besoin d'amour express

Non tu ne partiras pas
Partiras pas
Partiras pas...


J'avais dans mon coeur tant de larmes
Plus envie de vivre un seul jour
J'avais dans ma vie tant de drames
Je ne voulais plus être en amour
Il est arrivé plein de charme
Dans un sourire qui dis bonjour
Il avait les mots qui désarment
J'avais tellement besoin d'amour
Simplement, doucement
Il est entré dans mon coeur
Simplement, doucement
Il m'a donné le bonheur

Il suffisait de peu de choses
Pour qu'à nouveau j'aime la vie
Que dans ma main sa main se pose
Pour que je l'aime à la folie
Pour lui j'ai déposé les armes
J'ai envie de l'aimer toujours
Ces rires ont remplacés mes larmes
J'avais tellement besoin d'amour

Je l'aime tout simplement
Et moi je l'aime tout simplement...


Réveille-toi brother
Réveille-toi brother
Réveille-toi brother...
Black dans la peau, dans les mots, le coeur
T'entends des choses qui t'font mal au coeur
Des mots idiots qui voudraient
Changer ta couleur
Et tu chantes haut
T'essayes de cacher ta douleur

En silence
Tu chantes le blues
Enchaîné par la différence
En cadence
Un rythme fou s'éveille
Du gospel dans la voix
Réveille-toi brother!!!

On dit de toi que pour toi c'est facile
Moi j'sais que sans toi
Plus de soul, de soul dans les villes
Même le coeur des églises
Vibre au son de ta voix
Et quoi qu'on n'en dise
Ta musique noire est toujours là

En silence
Tu chantes le blues
Enchaîné par la différence
En cadence
Un rythme fou s'éveille
Du gospel dans la voix
Réveille-toi brother


Plus que tout
C'est comme ça que tu voulais l'aimer
Rien que nous
Tu lui disais pour la faire rêver
Après tout
Lui mentir ne t'as pas servis
Tu es là tout seul le coeur désuni
Pour toujours
Douceur, tendresse elle t'avait juré
Par amour
Elle s'était donnée
Sans détour
Elle voulait t'aimer
Ça t'faisait peur
Ces overdoses de bonheur

Dire
Que tu réalises à ton tour
Que vivre sans elle, c'est l'enfer tous les jours
Libre tu te prends à tout détester
Même cette liberté
Tu te sens emprisonné
Dire
Que tu regrettes à n'en crever
C'est pire tu t'accuses d'avoir mal aimé
Dire que tout semblait parfait
Tu voudrais courir, la ratrapper

Dire encore
Que ses yeux désarmants
Vibrent fort
Dans tes rêves noirs et blancs
Vivre alors que tout s'éclaire trop tard
Vivre fort comme s'il restait de l'espoir


Petit homme
P'tit bonhomme d'aujourd'hui
Tu t'étonnes de cette étrange vie
Pour un homme, un inconnu
Un dieu que t'as jamais vu
On se bat tu t'demandes pourquoi
Il suffit d'un éclair
Pour déchainer le bruit du tonnere
Il suffit d'un éclair
Pour que coule bien trop de larmes amères
Tous ces canons inutiles
Je te sens tellement fragile
Pourquoi ces éclairs

Petit gars t'avances pas dans cette vie
Trop petit, l'univers de tes nuits
À l'école on t'apprend l'amour
D'une loi sainte cousue de velours
Pour laquelle tu te battras un jour...

Pourquoi ces éclairs
Et cette envie de vivre qui s'éveille
Pour qui la misère
Où es-tu Dieu le père

Où es-tu
Où es-tu
Où es-tu


Non j'veux pas chanter
Sur des mots qui pleurent
Comme le cri d'un violon trop noir
Nous on voit la vie avec les yeux du cœur
Rien nous empêchera d'y croire
Croire au nouveau monde
qu'on a dans la tête
Croire en nous pour changer demain
Croire même aux mensonges
si ça les arrête
Croire aux lignes de nos mains

Croire au ciel inondé d'oiseaux
Croire encore à l'espace de tes bras
Croire à la couleur de ta peau
Croire qu'on marchera plus au pas

Croire au temps quand on a vingt ans
Croire qu'on peut construire
Sur un sol volcan
Croire qu'on peut crier au fou
Quand on a l'amour en nous

Qui c'e il buio fuori di me 

ed anche un po dentro di me... 

che assurdita questa citta 

senza persone! 



Io non so spiegar neanche come 

ma non e questa la mia dimensione, 

e la mia mente non e mai in pace, 

e sempre altrove. 



Tu dove sei? La tua voce dov'e? 

Senza di te, senza il tuo aiuto 

che sara di me? 



Tutto sembrera migliore 

alla luce che verra dal sole! 

Questa notte passera, 

il buio che c'e si dissolvera! 



Si vedranno le colline, 

io continuero a cercare te. 



Via da questa malinconia, 

invidia o rabbia che sia. 

Qui nel mio cuore 

non voglio piu queste parole. 



Tu dove sei? Il tuo sorriso dov'e? 

Senza di te, senza il tuo amore 

che sara di me? 



Tutto sembrera migliore 

alla luce che verra dal sole! 

Questa notte passera, 

il buio che c'e si dissolvera! 



E alla luce di quel sole 

Io continuero a cercare te. 



Tutto sembrera migliore, 

alla luce, al sole. 

Il silenzio morira, 

la gente che c'e si confondera. 



E alla luce di quel sole 

Io continuero a cercare te.


IL MONDO GIRA CON ME QUESTA NOTTE 

PICCOLI PASSI CHE FACCIO CON TE 

SEGUO IL TUO CUORE E SEGUO LA LUNA 

COSI' NASCOSTA LONTANA DA ME 

IL MONDO GIRA CON NOI QUESTA NOTTE 

AHHHH, ESISTESSE LONTANO DA QUI 



UN POSTO DOVE SCOPRIRE IL MIO CUORE 

SAPERE SE LUI PUO' AMARE TI O NO 



E GIRERA E GIRERA 

IL CUORE MIO ASSIEME A TE 

E GIRERA IL LA TERRA 

GIRERA LA MIA VITA 

E UN GIORNO LUI SI SI CAPRIRA 



SEI TU CHE GIRI CON ME QUESTA NOTTE 

SEI TU CHE GIRI LONTANA DA QUI 

MA SI IO SO CHE TU SEI LA MIA LUNA 

QUALCOSA MOSTRI QUALCOSA NO 



CI SONO STRADE AZZURRE NEL CIELO 

CI SONO OCCHI E IL CIELO E GIA LI 



SI QUESTO CREDO CESIANO LE STELLE 

AHHH, SE POTESSI FERMARMI COSI' 



E GIRERA E GIRERA 

IL CUORE MIO LONTAN DA TE 

E GIRERA IL LA TERRA 

GIRERA LA MIO VITA 

E UN GIORNO LUI SI SI CAPRIRA 



CUORE E GIA LONTANO 

SI TU SEI LA LUNA 

POTESSI SCOPRIRLO NEL CIELO 



E GIRERA E GIRERA 

SI GIRERA IL CUORE MIO 

GIRERA IL LA TERRA 

GIRERA LA MIA VITA 

UN GIORNO LUI SI SI CAPRIRA 

UN GIORNO LUI SI TI CAPRIRA


Through the darkness 

I can see your light 

And you will always shine 

And I can feel your heart in mine 

Your face I've memorized 

I idolize just you 



I look up to 

Everything you are 

In my eyes you do no wrong 

I've loved you for so long 

And after all is said and done 

You're still you 

After all 

You're still you 



You walk past me 

I can feel your pain 

Time changes everything 

One truth always stays the same 

You're still you 

After all 

You're still you 



I look up to 

Everything you are 

In my eyes you do no wrong 

And I believe in you 

Although you never asked me to 

I will remember you 

And what life put you through 



And in this cruel and lonely world 

I found one love 

You're still you 

After all 

You're still you


Se tu fossi nei miei occhi per un giorno
Vedresti la bellezza che piena d'allegria
Io trovo dentro gli occhi tuoi
E ignoro se è magia o realtà.

Se tu fossi nel mio cuore per un giorno
Potresti avere un'idea
Di ciò che sento io
Quando mi abbracci forte a te
E petto a petto, noi
Respiriamo insieme

Protagonista del tuo amor
Non so se sia magia o realtà

Se tu fossi nella mia anima un giorno
Sapresti cosa sento in me
Che m'innamorai
Da quell'istante insieme a te
E ciò che provo è
Solamente amore.

Da quell'istante insieme a te
E ciò che provo è
Solamente amore.


Who can say for certain
Maybe you're still here
I feel you all around me
Your memory's so clear

Deep in the stillness
I can hear you speak
You're still an inspiration
Can it be
That you are mine
Forever love
And you are watching over me from up above

Fly me up to where you are
Beyond the distant star
I wish upon tonight
To see you smile
If only for awhile to know you're there
A breath away's not far
To where you are

Are you gently sleeping
Here inside my dream
And isn't faith believing
All power can't be seen

As my heart holds you
Just one beat away
I cherish all you gave me everyday
'Cause you are my
Forever love
Watching me from up above

And I believe
That angels breathe
And that love will live on and never leave

Fly me up
To where you are
Beyond the distant star
I wish upon tonight
To see you smile
If only for awhile
To know you're there
A breath away's not far
To where you are

I know you're there
A breath away's not far
To where you are


Jamas senti en el alma tanto amor

Y nadie mas que tu, me amo 

Por ti rei y llore, renaci tambien



Lo que tuve di, por tenerte aqui

Ya se que despedirnos es mejor

Sufriendo pagare mi error

Ya nada sera igual, lo tengo que aceptar

Ya hallar la fuerza en mi para este adios

    

Alejate, no puedo mas

Ya no hay manera de volver el tiempo atras

Olvidate de mi

Y dejame seguir a solas con mi soledad

Alejate, ya dime adios

Y me resignare a seguir sin tu calor

Y jamas entedere que fue lo que paso

Si nada puedo hacer, alejate

    

No voy a arrepentirme del ayer

Amando te hise mujer

Por el amor aquel, por serte siempre fiel

Hoy tengo que ser fuerte y aprender

    

Alejate, no puedo mas

Ya no hay manera de volver el tiempo atras

Olvidate de mi

Y dejame seguir a solas con mi soledad

Alejate, ya dime adios

Y me resignara seguir sin tu calor

Y jamas entedere que fue lo que paso

Si nada puedo hacer, alejate

    

Alejate, no puedo mas

Ya no hay manera de volver el tiempo atras

Olvidate de mi

Y dejame seguir a solas con mi soledad

Alejate, ya dime adios

Y me resignara seguir sin tu calor

Y jamas entedere que fue lo que paso

Si nada puedo hacer, alejate


Dedicato a chi colpevole o innocente
perso in questo mare
si è arreso alla corrente
chi non è mai stato vincente?

Dedicato a chi aspetta una speranza

davanti ad un dolore
nel freddo di una stanza

Dedicato a chi cerca la sua libertà

Canto alla vita
alla sua bellezza
ad ogni sua ferita
ogni sua caressa

STRU.

I sing to life and to it's tragic beauty
To pain and to strife, but all that dances through me
The rise and the fall; i've lived through it all

Dedicato a chi la sente inaridita
come fosse sabbia asciutta fra le dita
e la sente già finita

Canto alla vita
negli occhi tuoi riflessa
fragile e infinita
terra a noi promessa

Canto alla vita
canto a voce piena
a questo nostro viaggio
che ancora ci incatena

Ci chiama

Non dubitare mai
Non dubitare mai
Non lasciarla mai da sola
da sola
... ancora ...

Canto alla vita
alla sua bellezza

Canto alla vita
canto a voce piena
a questo nostro viaggio
che ancora ci incatena

Ci chiama...


Let me fall 

Let me climb 

There's a moment when fear 

And dreams must collide 



Someone I am 

Is waiting for courage 

The one I want 

The one I will become 

Will catch me 



So let me fall 

If I must fall 

I won't heed your warnings 

I won't hear them 



Let me fall 

If I fall 

Though the phoenix may 

Or may not rise 



I will dance so freely 

Holding on to no one 

You can hold me only 

If you too will fall 

Away from all these 

Useless fears and chains 



Someone I am 

Is waiting for my courage 

The one I want 

The one I will become 

Will catch me 



So let me fall 

If I must fall 

I won't heed your warnings 

I won't hear 



Let me fall 

If I fall 

There's no reason 

To miss this one chance 

This perfect moment 

Just let me fall


Starry, starry night 

Paint your palette blue and grey 

Look out on a summer's day 

With eyes that know the darkness in my soul 

Shadows on the hills 

Sketch the trees and daffodils 

Catch the breeze and the winter chills 

In colours on the snowy linen land 



Now I understand 

What you tried to say to me 

And how you suffered for your sanity 

And how you tried to set them free 

They would not listen 

They did not know how 

Perhaps they'll listen now 



Starry, starry night 

Flaming flowers that brightly blaze 

Swirling clouds and violet haze 

Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue 

Colours changing hue 

Morning fields of amber grain 

Weathered faces lined in pain 

Are soothed beneath the artists' loving hand 



Now I understand 

What you tried to say to me 

And how you suffered for your sanity 

And how you tried to set them free 

They would not listen 

They did not know how 

Perhaps they'll listen now 



For they could not love you 

But still your love was true 

And when no hope was left inside 

On that starry, starry night 

You took your life as lovers often do 

But I could have told you Vincent 

This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you 



Like the strangers that you've met 

The ragged men in ragged clothes 

The silver thorn of bloody rose 

Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow 



Now I think I know 

What you tried to say to me 

And how you suffered for your sanity 

And how you tried to set them free 

They would not listen 

They're not listening still 

Perhaps they never will...


Ecco ora mai, il momento temuto da tempo, sai 

Gia so quello che mi dirai, e la fine di noi. 



So che con lui 

tu ti senti piu 

libera di essere 

di volere, di prendere 

di contare di piu 



Che sciocco io 

io che ti ho dato tutto di me 

Ora che vai 

stai portando il mio cuore con te. 



Un amore per sempre 

dura solo un istante 

Sono tanti ricordi che 

svaniscono in te 

Resta forse quel sogno 

Una storia di amanti 

ma a la fine vai via 

da me 



Questa citta` che mi penso 

deserto di lacrime 

Sento il cuore affogato in me 

Mentre tu sei con lui 



Dicono che no si muore nel'amore 

Non perdi mai 

Io mi sento morire ormai 

fuoco dentro di me 



So pure che dovrei essere felice per te 



Ma, mentirei, perche volgio che resti con me 



Un amore per sempre 

Dura solo un istante 

Sono tanti ricordi 

che svaniscono in te 



Resta forse quel sogno 

una storia di amanti 

Ma la fine di verlo 

te ne vai, vai con duole 



Un amore per sempre 

dura solo un istante 

Sono troppi ricordi 

che svaniscono in te 

Resta quel che momento 

forse solo un istante 

Ma la fine vai via 

lontano da me
